        For this metric, we used the CodeSearchNet dataset, which contains code and human descriptions of the code. 
        We used the descriptions to input 300 prompts and compared the generated results to the correct code. 
        Note that not all of the descriptions returned valid code, which is why the final number of samples may not be 300.
        We evaluated the results using BLEU score, a common text metric that looks at the substrings in common.
        A BLEU score of above 50% is considered optimal, since this means a bulk of the generated code is correct.
