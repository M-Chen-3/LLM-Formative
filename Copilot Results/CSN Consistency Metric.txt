Please generate a Python function that does the following with only the code box and no example usage:

Executes SQL using psycopg2 copy_expert method.
        Necessary to execute COPY command without access to a superuser.

        Note: if this method is called with a "COPY FROM" statement and
        the specified input file does not exist, it creates an empty
        file and no data is loaded, but the operation succeeds.
        So if users want to be aware when the input file does not exist,
        they have to check its existence by themselves.
