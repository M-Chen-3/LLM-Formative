Please generate a Python function that does the following: Extracts video ID from URL.
Copilot said
Here's a Python function to extract a video ID from a URL. This example assumes you're working with URLs from platforms like YouTube, where video IDs are typically included as query parameters or path segments:

python

Copy
import re
from urllib.parse import urlparse, parse_qs

def extract_video_id(url):
    """
    Extracts the video ID from a given URL.
    
    :param url: The URL to extract the video ID from.
    :return: The video ID or None if not found.
    """
    try:
        # Parse the URL
        parsed_url = urlparse(url)
        
        # Check for query parameters (e.g., YouTube URLs with ?v=)
        query_params = parse_qs(parsed_url.query)
        if 'v' in query_params:
            return query_params['v'][0]
        
        # Check for video ID in the path (e.g., short YouTube URLs like youtu.be/<id>)
        pattern = re.compile(r'/(embed|shorts|watch/|v/|[^/]+)$')
        match = pattern.search(parsed_url.path)
        if match:
            return match.group(0).strip('/')
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    
    return None

# Example usage
url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"
video_id = extract_video_id(url)
print(f"Video ID: {video_id}")
This function handles URLs where the video ID might appear as part of the query string (e.g., ?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) or in the path (e.g., https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ). Feel free to adapt it further for other platforms if needed!

str->list
    Convert XML to URL List.
    From Biligrab.
Copilot said
Here's a Python function to extract URLs from an XML string, tailored for parsing XML data to retrieve URL lists. It uses the xml.etree.ElementTree library for XML parsing:

python

Copy
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def convert_xml_to_url_list(xml_string):
    """
    Converts an XML string to a list of URLs.
    
    :param xml_string: The XML string to parse.
    :return: A list of URLs.
    """
    url_list = []
    
    try:
        # Parse the XML string
        root = ET.fromstring(xml_string)
        
        # Iterate over all 'url' elements in the XML
        for url_element in root.findall(".//url"):
            url = url_element.text
            if url:
                url_list.append(url)
                
    except ET.ParseError as e:
        print(f"Error parsing XML: {e}")
    
    return url_list

# Example usage
xml_data = """<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<root>
    <video>
        <url>http://example.com/video1</url>
    </video>
    <video>
        <url>http://example.com/video2</url>
    </video>
</root>"""

url_list = convert_xml_to_url_list(xml_data)
print("URL List:", url_list)
Explanation:
The xml.etree.ElementTree library is used to parse the XML.

It locates all url tags within the XML structure using the .findall(".//url") method.

Any URL found in the url tag's text content is added to the output list.

Feel free to adapt the tag names (url) or parsing logic to fit Biligrab-specific XML structures if needed!

wrapper
Copilot said
Here’s an example of a Python wrapper function. Wrappers are often used to add extra functionality (like logging, timing, or error handling) around an existing function using decorators. Here's an example of a generic wrapper:

python

Copy
import time

def wrapper(func):
    """
    A generic wrapper function to enhance the functionality of the given function.
    
    :param func: The function to wrap.
    :return: The wrapped function.
    """
    def wrapped_function(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling function: {func.__name__}")
        print(f"Arguments: {args} {kwargs}")
        
        start_time = time.time()
        try:
            # Call the original function
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            print(f"Function executed successfully. Result: {result}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error occurred: {e}")
            raise
        finally:
            end_time = time.time()
            print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        
        return result
    return wrapped_function

# Example usage
@wrapper
def example_function(a, b):
    return a + b

# Call the wrapped function
example_function(5, 7)
How it works:
The wrapper function accepts another function (func) as an argument and returns a new function (wrapped_function).

Inside wrapped_function, additional functionality is added:

Logs the function's name and arguments.

Measures execution time.

Handles potential errors during execution.

The @wrapper syntax is used to apply this decorator to any function.

This can be customized further depending on your specific requirements. For instance, you can add functionality like input validation, caching, or other enhancements! Let me know if you'd like additional examples or tailored use cases.

wrapper
Copilot said
Sure! Here's a simple example of a Python wrapper function, often used for enhancing the behavior of other functions. This wrapper adds logging to track when a function is called and its result:

python

Copy
def wrapper_function(func):
    """
    A generic wrapper function to add logging to any function.
    
    :param func: The function to be wrapped.
    :return: The wrapped function with added logging.
    """
    def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Function '{func.__name__}' is called with arguments {args} and keyword arguments {kwargs}.")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"Function '{func.__name__}' returned: {result}.")
        return result
    
    return wrapped

# Example usage
@wrapper_function
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Call the wrapped function
add_numbers(5, 10)
How it works:
wrapper_function is a higher-order function that takes another function (func) as an argument.

It returns a new function, wrapped, which:

Logs the name and arguments of the original function when it’s called.

Logs the result after executing the original function.

You apply this wrapper to a function using the @wrapper_function decorator.

Feel free to adapt the wrapper to add other functionality, such as timing the execution or handling errors. Let me know if you'd like to explore those options!

Get item_id
Copilot said
Here’s a Python function to extract an item_id from a given input. I’ve designed it to work with a URL or structured data containing an item_id:

python

Copy
import re

def get_item_id(input_string):
    """
    Extracts the item_id from the given input string.
    
    :param input_string: The input string (e.g., URL or text) containing the item_id.
    :return: The extracted item_id or None if not found.
    """
    try:
        # Define a regular expression pattern to capture item_id (e.g., numeric or alphanumeric)
        pattern = r"item_id=([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)"
        
        # Search for the pattern in the input string
        match = re.search(pattern, input_string)
        if match:
            return match.group(1)  # Return the captured item_id
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    
    return None

# Example usage
example_input = "https://example.com/product?item_id=12345&ref=homepage"
item_id = get_item_id(example_input)
print(f"Extracted item_id: {item_id}")
Explanation:
The function uses a regular expression (re.search) to look for the item_id in the input string.

The pattern r"item_id=([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)" matches:

The text item_id=.

Followed by one or more alphanumeric characters, underscores, or hyphens.

If a match is found, the captured item_id is returned; otherwise, the function returns None.

Let me know if this works for your use case or if you'd like a more customized approach!

Key Points:
prepare Method:

Fetches video metadata (like title or download URL) from the API. Update the API URL and response parsing logic as needed for BokeCC.

download_video Method:

Downloads the video using the metadata returned by prepare().

If no title is provided, it attempts to fetch one from the API's metadata.

Placeholder Download Logic:

Replace the placeholder code with actual downloading logic (e.g., using requests to stream and save the video file).

Feel free to customize the code further based on the exact API response format or additional requirements! Let me know if you need help with anything else.

Extracts video ID from live.qq.com. Please generate a Python function that does the following: 
Format text with color or other effects into ANSI escaped string.
Copilot said
Here are two Python functions, one for each task you described:

1. Extract Video ID from live.qq.com
This function extracts the video ID from a live.qq.com URL using Python's re module for regular expression parsing:

python

Copy
import re

def extract_video_id(url):
    """
    Extracts the video ID from a live.qq.com URL.

    :param url: The URL to extract the video ID from.
    :return: The extracted video ID or None if not found.
    """
    try:
        # Regex pattern to capture video ID (assuming it's a numeric or alphanumeric string)
        pattern = r"live.qq.com/[^/]+/([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)"
        match = re.search(pattern, url)
        if match:
            return match.group(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    
    return None

# Example usage
url = "https://live.qq.com/somecategory/12345abcde"
video_id = extract_video_id(url)
print(f"Video ID: {video_id}")
2. Format Text with ANSI Escape Codes
This function allows you to format text with colors and effects using ANSI escape codes. This is commonly used in terminals that support ANSI colors:

python

Copy
def format_text_with_ansi(text, color="default", effect="none"):
    """
    Formats text with ANSI escape codes for color and effects.

    :param text: The text to format.
    :param color: The color to apply ('red', 'green', 'blue', etc.).
    :param effect: The effect to apply ('bold', 'underline', etc.).
    :return: The formatted ANSI string.
    """
    # ANSI color and effect codes
    colors = {
        "default": "39", "red": "31", "green": "32", "yellow": "33",
        "blue": "34", "magenta": "35", "cyan": "36", "white": "37"
    }
    effects = {
        "none": "0", "bold": "1", "underline": "4", "reversed": "7"
    }
    
    # Get the ANSI codes for the requested color and effect
    color_code = colors.get(color, "39")
    effect_code = effects.get(effect, "0")

Print a log message to standard error.
Copilot said
Here's a Python function that prints a log message to standard error (stderr). The sys module is used to handle stderr output:

python

Copy
import sys

def log_to_stderr(message, level="INFO"):
    """
    Prints a log message to standard error (stderr).
    
    :param message: The log message to print.
    :param level: The log level (e.g., 'INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR'). Default is 'INFO'.
    """
    try:
        # Format the log message with the specified level
        log_message = f"[{level}] {message}"
        
        # Print the log message to stderr
        print(log_message, file=sys.stderr)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error writing log to stderr: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Example usage
log_to_stderr("This is a log message.")
log_to_stderr("This is a warning message.", level="WARNING")
log_to_stderr("An error occurred!", level="ERROR")
How it works:
The sys.stderr stream is used to send output directly to standard error.

The log message includes a level parameter (default is "INFO") to indicate the severity of the log.

You can customize the log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, etc.) or add more functionality as needed.

This function is lightweight and useful for applications that need to log messages, especially when debugging or handling errors. Let me know if you'd like me to enhance it further, such as including timestamps or integrating it with a logging framework!

    # Log the error message
    logging.error(message)

# Example usage
log_error("An unexpected error occurred while processing the data.")
How it works:
Logging Configuration:

The logging.basicConfig sets the format and logging level (ERROR in this case).

The format includes a timestamp, the log level, and the message itself.

Logging Error:

logging.error(message) outputs the error message.

This method provides a structured and scalable way to log errors, making it especially useful for larger applications. You can expand this by directing logs to a file, adding more levels (e.g., INFO, WARNING), or integrating with logging frameworks. Let me know if you'd like to explore those options!

Here’s a whimsical Python function inspired by your input, “What a Terrible Failure!”—let's assume you want a function that logs catastrophic failures in a humorous way:

python

Copy
import sys

def what_a_terrible_failure(message):
    """
    Logs a catastrophic failure message to standard error (stderr).
    
    :param message: The failure message to log.

        failure_message = f"😱 WHAT A TERRIBLE FAILURE! 🚨: {message}"
        
        # Print the failure message to stderr
        print(failure_message, file=sys.stderr)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error logging failure: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Example usage
what_a_terrible_failure("The system has encountered an unexpected error!")
What it does:
The function logs a dramatic error message to standard error (stderr).

It uses emojis to add a bit of humor and emphasis, turning a terrible failure into something a little less grim.

Handles exceptions gracefully if there’s an issue logging the message itself.

Feel free to adapt this function to your specific needs or let me know if you'd like an entirely different take on it! 😉

        return None

# Example usage
os_details = detect_operating_system()
print("Operating System Details:")
print(os_details)
Explanation:
platform.system(): Returns the name of the operating system, such as "Windows", "Linux", or "Darwin" for macOS.

platform.release(): Provides the release version (e.g., Windows 10 or kernel version for Linux).

platform.version(): Returns more detailed version information about the OS.

platform.architecture(): Determines whether the system architecture is 64-bit or 32-bit.

os.uname(): Used to retrieve the hostname on Unix-like systems. For Windows systems, it uses the COMPUTERNAME environment variable as a fallback.

This function compiles comprehensive information about the operating system, making it suitable for diagnostics or application setup tasks. If you need additional data or modifications, feel free to let me know!

Source: Android mobile
Copilot said
It looks like you want a Python function related to "Source: Android mobile." Could you clarify the specific task you're looking for? For instance, are you aiming to:

Interact with Android devices (e.g., using ADB to send commands)?

Process Android-specific data (e.g., extract information from logs or files)?

Analyze something from an Android app or system?

str->None
Copilot said
Here is a Python function that takes a string (str) as input and performs some actions, ultimately returning None:

python

Copy
def process_string(input_string):
    """
    Processes the given string and performs an action.
    
    :param input_string: The string to process.
    :return: None
    """
    try:
        # Example: Print the string in uppercase
        print(f"Processed String: {input_string.upper()}")
        
        # You can add other actions here
        # Example: Log the string, count characters, etc.
        print(f"Character Count: {len(input_string)}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example usage
process_string("Hello, World!")
Explanation:
Input: A single string input_string is passed to the function.

Action: The function processes the string (e.g., converts it to uppercase and counts the characters).

Output: Prints the processed information and returns None, as the purpose is to perform actions rather than return a value.

str/int->None
Copilot said
Here is a Python function that accepts either a string (str) or an integer (int) as input and performs some actions. Since the return type is None, the function only processes the input without returning any value:

python

Copy
def process_input(data):
    """
    Processes the input data, which can be a string or an integer.
    
    :param data: The input data (str or int) to process.
    :return: None
    """
    if isinstance(data, str):
        # Handle the input as a string
        print(f"Processing string: {data}")
        print(f"String length: {len(data)}")
    elif isinstance(data, int):
        # Handle the input as an integer
        print(f"Processing integer: {data}")
        print(f"Square of the integer: {data ** 2}")
    else:
        print("Unsupported data type! Please provide a string or integer.")

# Example usage
process_input("Hello, World!")
process_input(42)
Explanation:
Input Handling:

Checks whether the input is of type str or int using isinstance.

If the input is a string, it processes it (e.g., prints the string and its length).

If the input is an integer, it processes it (e.g., calculates and prints its square).

Unsupported Types:

If the input is neither a string nor an integer, the function notifies the user with an appropriate message.

Return Value:

The function explicitly returns None by design, as it performs actions without returning any results.

Feel free to expand this logic to include other data types or additional operations! Let me know how else I can assist.

    Information for CKPlayer API content.
Copilot said
Here's a Python function that takes a string as input (e.g., a URL or API response related to CKPlayer) and converts it into a dictionary containing relevant information for CKPlayer API content. This example assumes the input is a JSON string, as APIs typically return data in JSON format:

python

Copy
import json

def parse_ckplayer_api_content(api_response):
    """
    Parses the CKPlayer API content from a JSON string into a dictionary.
    
    :param api_response: The API response string (in JSON format).
    :return: A dictionary containing the parsed information.
    """
    try:
        # Parse the JSON string into a dictionary
        content_dict = json.loads(api_response)
        
        # Extract relevant information from the content
        video_info = {
            "title": content_dict.get("title", "No title available"),
            "url": content_dict.get("video", {}).get("url", "No URL available"),
            "thumbnail": content_dict.get("thumbnail", "No thumbnail available"),
            "duration": content_dict.get("duration", "Unknown duration")
        }
        
        return video_info
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        print(f"Error decoding JSON: {e}")
        return {}

# Example usage
api_response = """

    "video": {
        "url": "https://example.com/video.mp4"
    },

    "duration": "120"
}
"""
parsed_content = parse_ckplayer_api_content(api_response)
print("Parsed CKPlayer API Content:")
print(parsed_content)
Explanation:
Input: The function expects a JSON string as input (e.g., a response from the CKPlayer API).

Parsing: It uses the json.loads function to convert the JSON string into a Python dictionary.

Extracting Information: The function extracts specific details like title, url, thumbnail, and duration. It provides fallback values (e.g., "No title available") if the keys are missing.

Error Handling: If the input is not valid JSON, the function catches the error and returns an empty dictionary.

You can customize the function further to match the exact structure of CKPlayer API responses or extract additional fields as needed! Let me know if you'd like further enhancements.

Here’s a Python function that takes a video ID as input, constructs a URL, and retrieves video details (e.g., metadata). This example assumes the video platform provides an API or endpoint where details can be fetched:

python

Copy
import requests

def get_video_details(base_url, video_id):
    """
    Splices the base URL with the video ID to retrieve video details.
    
    :param base_url: The base URL for the video platform's API or endpoint.
    :param video_id: The unique video ID.
    :return: A dictionary containing video details if successful, None otherwise.
    """
    try:
        # Construct the full URL by splicing the base URL with the video ID
        full_url = f"{base_url}/{video_id}"
        
        # Send a GET request to fetch video details
        response = requests.get(full_url)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for HTTP errors
        
        # Parse and return the video details (assuming JSON response)
        video_details = response.json()
        return video_details
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error fetching video details: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
base_url = "https://api.example.com/video"  # Replace with the actual base URL of the platform
video_id = "12345abcd"
video_details = get_video_details(base_url, video_id)
print("Video Details:", video_details)
Explanation:
Input Parameters:

base_url: The root URL of the API or video platform.

video_id: The unique identifier of the video.

URL Splicing:

Combines the base_url and video_id to create a complete endpoint.

HTTP Request:

Uses requests.get to send an HTTP GET request to the constructed URL.

Includes error handling with raise_for_status to catch HTTP errors.

Parsing Response:

Assumes the response is in JSON format and converts it into a Python dictionary for easy manipulation.

You can adapt this function to suit the specific API structure and video platform you are working with. Let me know if you'd like help with further customization! 🚀

import re

def extract_video_id(url, pattern=None):
    """
    Extracts the video ID from a URL using a regex pattern.
    
    :param url: The URL to extract the video ID from.
    :param pattern: Optional custom regex pattern for matching the video ID.
    :return: The extracted video ID, or None if not found.
    """
    try:
        # Default pattern to match common video ID formats (e.g., YouTube-style)
        if not pattern:
            pattern = r"(?:v=|\/)([a-zA-Z0-9_-]{11})"  # Example: Matches YouTube video IDs
        
        # Search for the video ID in the URL
        match = re.search(pattern, url)
        if match:
            return match.group(1)  # Return the video ID
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error occurred: {e}")
    
    return None

# Example usage
example_url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"
video_id = extract_video_id(example_url)
print(f"Extracted Video ID: {video_id}")
Explanation:
Default Pattern:

The regular expression r"(?:v=|\/)([a-zA-Z0-9_-]{11})" is crafted for URLs like YouTube, where video IDs are 11 characters long and may appear after v= or /.

Custom Patterns:

The optional pattern parameter allows you to provide a custom regex for other video platforms or formats.

Flexible Usage:

The function uses re.search to find the video ID. If no match is found, it returns None.

Example URL:

It extracts dQw4w9WgXcQ as the video ID from a YouTube URL.

Feel free to customize the regex to handle video URLs from specific platforms you are working with! Let me know if you need help adapting this further.

import re

def extract_real_urls(input_string):
    """
    Extracts real URLs from a given input string.
    
    :param input_string: The input string containing URLs.
    :return: A list of extracted URLs.
    """
    try:
        # Regular expression pattern to match URLs
        url_pattern = r"https?://[^\s]+"
        
        # Find all matches in the input string
        urls = re.findall(url_pattern, input_string)
        
        # Return the list of URLs
        return urls
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error extracting URLs: {e}")
        return []

# Example usage
example_string = """
Check out these links:
- https://www.example.com/resource1
- http://example.org/resource2
- Not a URL: example.com/resource3
"""
real_urls = extract_real_urls(example_string)
print("Extracted URLs:", real_urls)
Explanation:
Input: The function accepts a string that may contain URLs mixed with other text.

Regex Pattern: The url_pattern matches:

URLs starting with http:// or https://.

The [^\s]+ captures the rest of the URL until a space or line break is encountered.

Output:

A list of valid URLs extracted from the input string using re.findall.

Only complete URLs with http:// or https:// are included.

Error Handling: If an issue occurs (e.g., invalid input), an empty list is returned.

This approach ensures that real URLs are captured. Feel free to modify the regex pattern if your input contains specific formats or additional URL types! Let me know if you'd like further assistance. 🚀

Here are the three Python functions to achieve what you've asked for:

1. Get (branch, commit) from HEAD of a git repository:
This function retrieves the current branch name and latest commit hash of a git repository:

python

Copy
import subprocess

def get_git_head_info(repo_path="."):
    """
    Gets the current branch and latest commit hash from the HEAD of a git repository.
    
    :param repo_path: Path to the git repository. Default is the current directory.
    :return: A tuple (branch, commit) or (None, None) if an error occurs.
    """
    try:
        # Get the current branch name
        branch = subprocess.check_output(
            ["git", "-C", repo_path, "rev-parse", "--abbrev-ref", "HEAD"],
            stderr=subprocess.STDOUT
        ).strip().decode("utf-8")

        # Get the latest commit hash
        commit = subprocess.check_output(
            ["git", "-C", repo_path, "rev-parse", "HEAD"],
            stderr=subprocess.STDOUT
        ).strip().decode("utf-8")
        
        return branch, commit
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:

        return None, None

# Example usage
branch, commit = get_git_head_info()
print(f"Branch: {branch}, Commit: {commit}")
2. Convert a string to a valid filename:
This function sanitizes a string to make it a valid filename by removing or replacing invalid characters:

python

Copy
import re

def to_valid_filename(input_string):
    """
    Converts a string into a valid filename by removing invalid characters.
    
    :param input_string: The string to convert.
    :return: A sanitized valid filename.
    """
    # Replace invalid filename characters with underscores
    sanitized = re.sub(r'[<>:"/\\|?*\n\r\t]', "_", input_string)
    
    # Optional: Limit the filename length if needed
    return sanitized.strip()

# Example usage
filename = to_valid_filename("My <Invalid>:Filename?.txt")
print(f"Valid Filename: {filename}")
3. Get (width, height) of the current terminal:
This function retrieves the width and height of the current terminal using os and shutil modules:

python

Copy
import shutil

def get_terminal_size():
    """
    Gets the current terminal's width and height.
    
    :return: A tuple (width, height) representing the terminal size.
    """
    try:
        size = shutil.get_terminal_size()
        return size.columns, size.lines
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return None, None

# Example usage
width, height = get_terminal_size()
print(f"Terminal Size - Width: {width}, Height: {height}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Entry point of the script
    main()
Key Concepts:
main Function:

Acts as the central place where your script logic resides.

Keeps the script organized, especially for larger projects.

if __name__ == "__main__"::

Ensures the main function is only executed when the script is run directly (not imported as a module).

Extending the Functionality:

Replace the placeholder functionality with the actual logic relevant to you-get-dev or your custom requirements.

print("Single pattern result:", result_single)

# Multiple patterns
result_multiple = scan_for_patterns(text_to_scan, pattern_1, pattern_2)
print("Multiple pattern result:", result_multiple)
Explanation:
Input Handling:

Accepts a string (text) and an arbitrary number of regex patterns (*patterns).

Regex Matching:

For each regex pattern, it searches for the first match in the text using re.search.

If a match is found, the first subgroup (group(1)) is extracted and added to the results.

Return Value:

If only one pattern is provided, the function returns a single string (or None if no match is found).

If multiple patterns are provided, it returns a list of matched strings (or an empty list if no matches are found).

Here's a Python function that scans through a string to find substrings matching a list of regex patterns, returning all matches as a list:

python

Copy
import re

def find_substrings(text, patterns):
    """
    Scans through a string for substrings that match any of the provided regex patterns.
    
    Args:
        text: A string to be scanned.
        patterns: A list of regex patterns.
    
    Returns:
        A list of matched substrings. Returns an empty list if no matches are found.
    """
    matches = []
    
    for pattern in patterns:
        # Find all matches for the current pattern
        current_matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
        # Add the matches to the result list
        matches.extend(current_matches)
    
    return matches

# Example usage
text_to_scan = "The price is $100 and the discount code is ABC123."
patterns_to_match = [
    r"The price is \$(\d+)",  # Matches the price value
    r"discount code is (\w+)"  # Matches the discount code
]

result = find_substrings(text_to_scan, patterns_to_match)
print("Matched Substrings:", result)
Explanation:
Input:

text: The input string to scan for matches.

patterns: A list of regex patterns to use for matching.

Processing:

Loops through each pattern in the patterns list.

Uses re.findall to find all matches for the current pattern in the text.

Appends these matches to the matches list.

Output:

Returns a list of all substrings that matched any of the patterns.

If no matches are found, it returns an empty list.

Example:

Given the string "The price is $100 and the discount code is ABC123." and the patterns:

r"The price is \$(\d+)" captures 100.

r"discount code is (\w+)" captures ABC123.

The function returns ['100', 'ABC123'].

Decompresses data for Content-Encoding: gzip.
Copilot said
Here are two Python functions based on your requirements:

1. Parsing the Query String of a URL
This function parses a query string in a URL and retrieves the value of a specified parameter:

python

Copy
from urllib.parse import urlparse, parse_qs

def get_query_param(url, param):
    """
    Parses the query string of a URL and returns the value of a specified parameter.

    Args:
        url: A URL string to parse.
        param: The name of the parameter to retrieve.

    Returns:
        The value of the parameter, or None if the parameter is not found.
    """
    try:
        # Parse the query part of the URL
        query = urlparse(url).query
        # Parse the query string into a dictionary
        params = parse_qs(query)
        # Return the value of the specified parameter (if it exists)
        return params.get(param, [None])[0]
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error parsing URL: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
url = "https://example.com/page?name=JohnDoe&age=30"
param_name = "name"
value = get_query_param(url, param_name)
print(f"Value of '{param_name}': {value}")
2. Decompressing Data for Content-Encoding: Gzip
This function decompresses gzip-encoded data using the gzip module:

python

Copy
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def decompress_gzip(data):
    """
    Decompresses gzip-encoded data.

    Args:
        data: A bytes object containing gzip-encoded content.

    Returns:
        The decompressed content as a string.
    """
    try:
        # Create a BytesIO stream from the input data
        buffer = BytesIO(data)
        # Decompress the gzip data
        with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=buffer, mode="rb") as gzip_file:
            decompressed_data = gzip_file.read()
        return decompressed_data.decode("utf-8")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error decompressing gzip data: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
compressed_data = gzip.compress(b"Hello, World!")
decompressed = decompress_gzip(compressed_data)
print("Decompressed Data:", decompressed)
Explanation:
Query String Parser:

Utilizes urllib.parse to extract and decode query string parameters.

Returns the value for the specified parameter or None if it doesn't exist.

Gzip Decompressor:

Reads gzip-encoded data using gzip.GzipFile and decompresses it.

Converts the decompressed data to a UTF-8 string for easy readability.

    Returns:
        The content as a string.
Copilot said
Here are two Python functions that meet your requirements:

1. Decompress Data for Content-Encoding: deflate
This function decompresses data encoded with the deflate algorithm using Python's zlib module:

python

Copy
import zlib

def decompress_deflate(data):
    """
    Decompresses data with Content-Encoding: deflate.

    Args:
        data: A bytes object containing deflate-encoded content.

    Returns:
        The decompressed content as a string.
    """
    try:
        # Decompress the deflate-encoded data
        decompressed_data = zlib.decompress(data)
        return decompressed_data.decode("utf-8")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error decompressing deflate data: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
compressed_data = zlib.compress(b"Hello, World!")
decompressed = decompress_deflate(compressed_data)
print("Decompressed Data:", decompressed)
2. Get the Content of a URL via HTTP GET Request
This function sends an HTTP GET request to a URL and retrieves the response content, with an option to decode the response body:

python

Copy
import requests

def get_url_content(url, headers=None, decoded=True):
    """
    Gets the content of a URL via an HTTP GET request.

    Args:
        url: A URL string to send the request to.
        headers: A dictionary of request headers used by the client.
        decoded: Whether to decode the response body using UTF-8 or the charset specified in Content-Type.

    Returns:
        The content as a string.
    """
    try:
        # Send the HTTP GET request
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for HTTP errors

        if decoded:
            # Attempt to decode using the Content-Type charset or UTF-8 as fallback
            content_type = response.headers.get("Content-Type", "")
            charset = "utf-8"  # Default charset
            if "charset=" in content_type:
                charset = content_type.split("charset=")[-1]
            return response.content.decode(charset)
        else:
            # Return raw content as a string
            return response.content
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching content: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
url = "https://example.com"
headers = {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"}
content = get_url_content(url, headers=headers, decoded=True)
print("URL Content:", content)
Key Points:
Deflate Decompression:

Uses the zlib.decompress() method to handle deflate-encoded data.

Decodes the decompressed bytes into a string using UTF-8.

HTTP GET Request:

Utilizes the requests library to send an HTTP GET request.

Decodes the response body based on the charset in the Content-Type header (or defaults to UTF-8).

Error Handling:

Both functions handle exceptions gracefully and return None if an error occurs.

These functions are versatile and should work for your needs. Let me know if you have additional requests or need further customization! 🚀

Parses host name and port number from a string.
Copilot said
Here are two Python functions to handle the tasks you've described:

1. Send Content via HTTP POST Request
This function sends a POST request to a specified URL and optionally decodes the response body:

python

Copy
import requests

def post_url_content(url, data=None, headers=None, decoded=True):
    """
    Posts content to a URL via an HTTP POST request.

    Args:

        headers: A dictionary of request headers used by the client.
        decoded: Whether to decode the response body using UTF-8 or the charset specified in Content-Type.

    Returns:
        The content as a string.
    """
    try:
        # Send the HTTP POST request
        response = requests.post(url, data=data, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for HTTP errors

        if decoded:
            # Attempt to decode using the Content-Type charset or UTF-8 as fallback
            content_type = response.headers.get("Content-Type", "")
            charset = "utf-8"  # Default charset
            if "charset=" in content_type:
                charset = content_type.split("charset=")[-1]
            return response.content.decode(charset)
        else:
            # Return raw content as a string
            return response.content
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error posting content: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
url = "https://example.com/api"
payload = {"key": "value"}
headers = {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"}
response_content = post_url_content(url, data=payload, headers=headers, decoded=True)
print("Response Content:", response_content)
2. Parse Hostname and Port Number from a String
This function extracts the hostname and port number from a URL or a similar string:

python

Copy
import re

def parse_host_and_port(input_string):
    """
    Parses the hostname and port number from a string.

    Args:
        input_string: A string containing a hostname and optionally a port number.

    Returns:
        A tuple (hostname, port) or (hostname, None) if the port is not found.
    """
    try:
        # Regex pattern to match hostname and port (e.g., example.com:8080)
        pattern = r"^(.*?):?(\d+)?$"
        match = re.match(pattern, input_string)
        
        if match:
            hostname = match.group(1)  # Hostname
            port = match.group(2)  # Port, if available
            return hostname, int(port) if port else None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error parsing host and port: {e}")
        return None, None

# Example usage
input_string = "example.com:8080"
hostname, port = parse_host_and_port(input_string)
print(f"Hostname: {hostname}, Port: {port}")
Explanation of the Functions:
HTTP POST Request Function:

post_url_content:

Sends an HTTP POST request with optional headers and payload (data).

Decodes the response body based on the Content-Type header or defaults to UTF-8.

Handles exceptions gracefully and returns None if an error occurs.

Hostname and Port Parser:

parse_host_and_port:

Uses a regex to separate the hostname and port.

Returns the hostname and port as a tuple ((hostname, port)).

If no port is specified, it returns None for the port.

These functions can be customized further to meet additional requirements. Let me know if you'd like further refinements! 🚀

Please generate a Python function that does the following: 
Overload default print function as py (<3.3) does not support 'flush' keyword.
    Although the function name can be same as print to get itself overloaded automatically,
    I'd rather leave it with a different name and only overload it when importing to make less confusion. Please generate a Python function that does the following: 
str->str
Copilot said
Here are two Python functions that satisfy your requests:

1. Overload print Function (to support flush in Python <3.3)
This function provides a custom print implementation that supports the flush parameter and can replace the default print function if desired:

python

Copy
import sys

def custom_print(*args, sep=" ", end="\n", file=sys.stdout, flush=False):
    """
    Custom print function to support the 'flush' keyword in Python <3.3.

    Args:
        *args: Values to print.
        sep: Separator between values. Default is a space.
        end: String appended after the last value. Default is a newline.
        file: File-like object where the output is sent. Default is sys.stdout.
        flush: Whether to forcibly flush the output buffer. Default is False.
    """
    output = sep.join(map(str, args)) + end
    file.write(output)
    if flush:
        file.flush()

# Example usage of the custom print function
custom_print("Hello", "World", flush=True)

# Overloading the default print function (if desired)
# import builtins
# builtins.print = custom_print
Explanation:

This function mimics the behavior of Python's default print, with additional support for the flush parameter.

The function is named custom_print to avoid confusion, but you can override the default print function by uncommenting the builtins.print assignment.

2. Convert a String (str -> str)
This function demonstrates a transformation of a string into another string. You can customize the transformation logic to suit your needs:

python

Copy
def transform_string(input_string):
    """
    Transforms a string by applying a custom transformation.

    Args:
        input_string: A string to be transformed.

    Returns:
        A transformed string.
    """
    # Example transformation: Reverse the string and make it uppercase
    return input_string[::-1].upper()

# Example usage
result = transform_string("Hello, World!")
print("Transformed String:", result)
Explanation:

The function transform_string processes a string and returns a transformed version (e.g., reversed and converted to uppercase in the example).

You can modify the transformation logic to match your specific use case.

Both functions are designed to be modular and easy to use. Let me know if you'd like further enhancements! 🚀

        topicID: An integer representing the topic ID.
        partID: An integer representing the part ID.

    Returns:
        A string containing the proper title.
    """
    try:
        # Parse the JSON object if it's a string
        if isinstance(data, str):
            data = json.loads(data)

        # Get course name, topic name, and part name if available in JSON

# Example usage
courseid = 101
topicID = 1
partID = 1
title = generate_title(data, courseid, topicID, partID)
print("Generated Title:", title)
Explanation:
Input:

data: The JSON object containing details about courses, topics, and parts. It can either be a Python dictionary or a JSON string.

courseid, topicID, partID: Integers that identify specific entries in the JSON structure.

Parsing and Lookup:

If the input data is a JSON string, it is parsed using json.loads.

The function retrieves the names of the course, topic, and part by their respective IDs.

Title Construction:

Combines the retrieved names into a single string separated by |. If an entry is not found, it defaults to Course-{courseid}, Topic-{topicID}, or Part-{partID}.

Error Handling:

Handles exceptions and provides a fallback title if something goes wrong.

Example Output: For the provided example JSON and IDs, the function generates:

Checks if a task is either queued or running in this executor

        :param task_instance: TaskInstance
        :return: True if the task is known to this executor
Copilot said
Here’s a Python function that demonstrates checking whether a task is either queued or running in a task executor. This function assumes you have an executor object, such as from a task scheduling or workflow management system (e.g., Apache Airflow):

python

Copy
class MockExecutor:
    """
    MockExecutor class for simulating task management.
    Tracks queued and running tasks for demonstration purposes.
    """
    def __init__(self):

        self.running_tasks = set()

    def queue_task(self, task_instance):
        self.queued_tasks.add(task_instance)

    def start_task(self, task_instance):
        if task_instance in self.queued_tasks:
            self.queued_tasks.remove(task_instance)
        self.running_tasks.add(task_instance)

    def complete_task(self, task_instance):
        self.running_tasks.discard(task_instance)

# Function definition
def is_task_known_to_executor(task_instance, executor):
    """
    Checks if a task is either queued or running in this executor.

    :param task_instance: TaskInstance (a string representing the task, for simplicity in this example)
    :param executor: An executor object that tracks queued and running tasks.
    :return: True if the task is known to this executor (queued or running), False otherwise.
    """
    return task_instance in executor.queued_tasks or task_instance in executor.running_tasks

# Example usage
executor = MockExecutor()

# Simulate task instances
task1 = "Task1"
task2 = "Task2"

# Queue and start tasks
executor.queue_task(task1)
executor.start_task(task2)

# Check if tasks are known to the executor
print(is_task_known_to_executor(task1, executor))  # Output: True (queued)
print(is_task_known_to_executor(task2, executor))  # Output: True (running)
print(is_task_known_to_executor("Task3", executor))  # Output: False (not known)
Explanation:
Executor Structure:

A mock MockExecutor class is created for demonstration. It tracks queued_tasks and running_tasks as sets.

Real implementations could interface with more advanced frameworks, such as task execution systems or distributed queues.

Function Logic:

The function checks if the task_instance is present in either the queued_tasks or running_tasks sets within the executor.

Returns True if the task is found in either state, otherwise False.

Usage:

Tasks (task_instance) are represented as strings for simplicity, but in real systems, these might be objects with detailed metadata.

Tasks can be queued, started (moved from queued to running), or completed (removed from running).

Feel free to integrate this with your specific executor system or let me know if you need further customization! 🚀

Here's a Python function that returns and flushes an event buffer, optionally filtered by dag_ids:

python

Copy
class EventBuffer:
    """
    A mock implementation of an event buffer to store and manage events.

        if dag_id not in self.buffer:
            self.buffer[dag_id] = []

    def get_and_flush_events(self, dag_ids=None):
        """
        Returns and flushes the event buffer. If dag_ids are specified,

            return events
        else:

specific_events = event_buffer.get_and_flush_events(dag_ids=["dag_1", "dag_3"])
print("Specific Events:", specific_events)

# Check remaining buffer
remaining_events = event_buffer.get_and_flush_events()
print("Remaining Events:", remaining_events)
Explanation:
Event Buffer Class:

The EventBuffer class maintains a dictionary where keys are dag_ids and values are lists of events.

Events are added using the add_event method.

Return and Flush Logic:

The get_and_flush_events method retrieves and clears the buffer.

If dag_ids is None, it flushes the entire buffer.

If specific dag_ids are provided, it flushes only events for those DAG IDs.

Example:

The example usage demonstrates adding events to the buffer and retrieving them either for specific DAG IDs or all at once.

It also shows that the buffer is cleared after retrieval.

Please generate a Python function that does the following: 
one method to fetch connection params as a dict
        used in get_uri() and get_connection() Please generate a Python function that does the following: 
override DbApiHook get_uri method for get_sqlalchemy_engine()
Copilot said
Here's an example of two Python functions that align with your requirements. These functions assume you're working within a framework similar to Apache Airflow, where DbApiHook is often used:

1. Method to Fetch Connection Parameters as a Dictionary
This method fetches connection parameters, typically from a connection object, and returns them as a dictionary for use in methods like get_uri() and get_connection():

python

Copy
def fetch_connection_params(connection):
    """
    Fetches connection parameters as a dictionary.
    This method can be used in get_uri() and get_connection().

    Args:
        connection: A connection object containing credentials and other details.

    Returns:
        A dictionary of connection parameters.
    """
    params = {
        "host": connection.host,
        "port": connection.port,
        "user": connection.login,
        "password": connection.password,
        "database": connection.schema,
        "extra": connection.extra_dejson  # Assuming extra is a JSON field
    }
    return params
2. Override DbApiHook's get_uri Method for get_sqlalchemy_engine()
This method overrides the get_uri method from DbApiHook to generate a connection URI suitable for use with SQLAlchemy engines:

python

Copy
from airflow.hooks.dbapi import DbApiHook

class CustomDbApiHook(DbApiHook):
    """
    Custom DbApiHook with an overridden get_uri method.
    This supports integration with get_sqlalchemy_engine.
    """

    def get_uri(self):
        """
        Overrides the get_uri method to provide a connection URI.
        Uses fetch_connection_params to build the URI.

        Returns:
            A connection URI string.
        """
        connection = self.get_connection(self.conn_id)
        params = fetch_connection_params(connection)

        # Construct the URI (example for PostgreSQL)
        uri = f"postgresql://{params['user']}:{params['password']}@{params['host']}:{params['port']}/{params['database']}"
        return uri

    def get_sqlalchemy_engine(self):
        """
        Provides a SQLAlchemy engine using the overridden get_uri method.

        Returns:
            An SQLAlchemy engine object.
        """
        from sqlalchemy import create_engine
        uri = self.get_uri()
        engine = create_engine(uri)
        return engine
Explanation
Fetch Connection Parameters:

The fetch_connection_params function retrieves important connection details (e.g., host, port, user, etc.) from a connection object and organizes them into a dictionary.

This allows flexibility for reuse in methods like get_uri() and get_connection().

Overridden get_uri:

The get_uri method constructs a database connection URI using the parameters retrieved from fetch_connection_params.

The example shows the URI for PostgreSQL, but you can modify it for other databases (e.g., MySQL, SQLite).

Integration with SQLAlchemy:

The get_sqlalchemy_engine method uses the overridden get_uri to create and return a SQLAlchemy engine instance.

Let me know if you'd like further customization or clarification! 🚀

Here are two Python functions based on your requirements:

1. Function to Return a Snowflake Connection Object
This function establishes and returns a connection to a Snowflake database using the snowflake.connector library:

python

Copy
import snowflake.connector

def get_snowflake_connection(user, password, account, warehouse, database, schema):
    """
    Returns a Snowflake connection object.

    Args:
        user: The Snowflake username.
        password: The Snowflake password.
        account: The Snowflake account identifier.
        warehouse: The Snowflake warehouse name.
        database: The Snowflake database name.
        schema: The Snowflake schema name.

    Returns:
        A snowflake.connector connection object.
    """
    try:
        connection = snowflake.connector.connect(
            user=user,
            password=password,
            account=account,
            warehouse=warehouse,
            database=database,
            schema=schema
        )
        return connection
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error connecting to Snowflake: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
# conn = get_snowflake_connection("user", "password", "account", "warehouse", "database", "schema")
# print(conn)
2. Function to Extract aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key from extra
This function parses a JSON-like extra field (commonly used in connection configurations) to retrieve AWS credentials:

python

Copy
import json

def get_aws_credentials_from_extra(extra):
    """
    Returns aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key from the 'extra' field.

    Args:
        extra: A JSON-like string containing additional connection info.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing (aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key).
    """
    try:
        # Parse the 'extra' field into a dictionary
        extra_dict = json.loads(extra)

        # Retrieve AWS credentials
        aws_access_key_id = extra_dict.get("aws_access_key_id")
        aws_secret_access_key = extra_dict.get("aws_secret_access_key")

        if aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key:
            return aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key
        else:
            raise KeyError("AWS credentials are not found in the extra field.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error retrieving AWS credentials: {e}")
        return None, None

# Example usage
# extra = '{"aws_access_key_id": "example_key", "aws_secret_access_key": "example_secret"}'
# aws_key, aws_secret = get_aws_credentials_from_extra(extra)
# print(f"AWS Access Key: {aws_key}, AWS Secret Access Key: {aws_secret}")
Explanation:
Snowflake Connection:

The get_snowflake_connection function uses the snowflake.connector.connect method to establish a connection.

Requires essential parameters like user, password, account, warehouse, database, and schema.

Returns the connection object, allowing you to query and interact with Snowflake.

AWS Credential Extraction:

The get_aws_credentials_from_extra function parses a JSON-formatted string (extra) to extract aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key.

It assumes the extra field contains these credentials in a key-value format.

These functions are ready to use and can be integrated into larger systems. Let me know if you need additional functionality or refinements! 🚀

        Note: if this method is called with a "COPY FROM" statement and
        the specified input file does not exist, it creates an empty
        file and no data is loaded, but the operation succeeds.
        So if users want to be aware when the input file does not exist,
        they have to check its existence by themselves.
Copilot said
Here are two Python functions based on your description:

1. Fetches a Field from extras
This function retrieves a field from the extras section of an Airflow connection object. In Airflow, the extras field allows additional parameters to be stored in JSON format:

python

Copy
import json

def fetch_field_from_extras(connection, field_name):
    """
    Fetches a field from the 'extras' of an Airflow connection.

    Args:
        connection: An Airflow connection object.
        field_name: The name of the field to fetch from extras.

    Returns:
        The value of the specified field, or None if the field is not found.
    """
    try:
        extras = connection.extra_dejson  # Parse extras as a dictionary
        return extras.get(field_name, None)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching field '{field_name}' from extras: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
# Assuming 'connection' is an Airflow connection object with extras
# field_value = fetch_field_from_extras(connection, "scope")
# print("Field Value:", field_value)
2. Executes SQL Using psycopg2's copy_expert
This function uses psycopg2's copy_expert method to execute a COPY command. It ensures that you can load data into a PostgreSQL database without requiring superuser permissions:

python

Copy
import psycopg2

def execute_copy_command(connection, sql, file_path):
    """
    Executes SQL using psycopg2's copy_expert method.

    Args:
        connection: A psycopg2 connection object to the database.
        sql: The COPY SQL statement to execute (e.g., "COPY table FROM stdin WITH CSV").
        file_path: Path to the input file for "COPY FROM" or output file for "COPY TO".

    Returns:
        None
    """
    try:
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            # Check if the input file exists (for COPY FROM)
            if "COPY FROM" in sql.upper():
                try:
                    with open(file_path, "r") as _:
                        pass  # Just checking the file existence
                except FileNotFoundError:
                    print(f"File not found: {file_path}. No data will be loaded.")
                    open(file_path, "w").close()  # Create an empty file to allow COPY to succeed

            # Execute the COPY command using copy_expert
            with open(file_path, "r" if "COPY FROM" in sql.upper() else "w") as file:
                cursor.copy_expert(sql, file)
            
            connection.commit()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error executing COPY command: {e}")
        connection.rollback()

# Example usage
# connection = psycopg2.connect(...)
# sql_statement = "COPY my_table FROM stdin WITH CSV"
# execute_copy_command(connection, sql_statement, "/path/to/input.csv")
Explanation:
Fetch Field from extras:

This function retrieves additional parameters stored in the extras field of an Airflow connection object.

The extras field is parsed as JSON (extra_dejson) to allow easy access to specific fields like scopes or credential files.

Execute COPY with copy_expert:

This function uses psycopg2's copy_expert method to execute a COPY command for loading or exporting data in PostgreSQL.

It ensures file existence checks when dealing with COPY FROM to prevent unintended empty loads.

Handles exceptions gracefully and rolls back transactions if something goes wrong.

Both functions are designed to be robust and modular. Let me know if further customization is needed! 🚀

            # Use the COPY command to load data into the table
            sql = f"COPY {table_name} FROM STDIN WITH DELIMITER '\t' CSV HEADER;"
            cursor.copy_expert(sql, file)

            # Commit the transaction
            connection.commit()
            print(f"Data from '{file_path}' successfully loaded into '{table_name}'.")

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File '{file_path}' not found.")
    except psycopg2.Error as e:
        print(f"Database error: {e}")
        connection.rollback()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    finally:
        if cursor:
            cursor.close()

# Example usage
# connection = psycopg2.connect("dbname=mydb user=myuser password=mypassword host=localhost")
# load_tab_delimited_file_to_db("data.tsv", "my_table", connection)
Explanation:
Input Parameters:

file_path: Path to the tab-delimited file.

table_name: Name of the database table where the data will be loaded.

connection: A valid psycopg2 connection object to the database.

COPY Command:

Executes the PostgreSQL COPY command using cursor.copy_expert.

The STDIN option reads directly from the file, ensuring efficiency for large data imports.

File Format:

Assumes the file uses a tab ('\t') as the delimiter and includes a header row.

Error Handling:

Captures exceptions for file-related issues (FileNotFoundError), database errors (psycopg2.Error), and general errors.

Transaction Management:

Commits the transaction upon success; rolls back in case of database errors.

Explanation:
Parse schema and table:

If the table is specified using dot notation (e.g., my_database.my_table), the schema parameter is ignored, and the schema is extracted from the table string.

HiveMetastoreHook:

Uses Airflow's HiveMetastoreHook to interact with the Hive Metastore and retrieve partition metadata.

Filter Partitions:

If a filter_map is provided, partitions are filtered to match the specified key-value pairs.

Infer Field:

If the field parameter is not specified, the function infers it by examining the first partition's structure.

Extract and Find Max:

Extracts the values of the specified field from the partitions and calculates the maximum value.

This function adheres to the requirements and provides flexibility for filtering and field inference. Let me know if you need further customization or examples! 🚀

target = date(2015, 1, 2)
print(find_closest_date(target, dates))  # Output: 2015-01-01
2. Find the Closest Partition Date in a Hive Table
This function, working with a hypothetical Hive table, finds the closest partition date based on given parameters:

python

Copy
from datetime import datetime
from airflow.providers.apache.hive.hooks.hive import HiveMetastoreHook

def closest_ds_partition(table, ds, before=None, metastore_conn_id="metastore_default"):

    :type ds: str
    :param before: Determines whether to find the closest date before (True),
                   after (False), or either side of the target date (None).

        # Find the closest date using the previous function
        closest_date = find_closest_date(target_date, partition_dates, before_target=before)
        return closest_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d") if closest_date else None

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error finding closest partition: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
# tbl = "airflow.static_babynames_partitioned"
# closest_date = closest_ds_partition(tbl, "2015-01-02", before=True)
# print(closest_date)  # Output: "2015-01-01"
Explanation:
Find Closest Date in List:

Searches the date_list for the closest match to target_dt.

If before_target is True, limits the search to dates before target_dt.

If before_target is False, limits the search to dates after target_dt.

If before_target is None, finds the closest date regardless of its position relative to target_dt.

Find Closest Partition Date in Hive Table:

Utilizes Airflow's HiveMetastoreHook to fetch partitions of the Hive table.

Extracts partition dates and finds the closest one to the given ds datestamp.

Handles optional constraints (before parameter) to restrict the search.

        database: The database name to connect to.

    Returns:
        A MySQL connection object.
    """
    try:
        connection = mysql.connector.connect(
            host=host,
            user=user,
            password=password,
            database=database
        )
        print("Connection established successfully!")
        return connection
    except mysql.connector.Error as e:
        print(f"Error connecting to MySQL: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
# connection = get_mysql_connection("localhost", "root", "password", "my_database")
2. Function to Load a Tab-Delimited File into a Database Table
This function loads data from a tab-delimited file into a specified MySQL database table:

python

Copy
def load_tab_delimited_file_to_table(file_path, table_name, connection):
    """

        connection.rollback()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
    finally:
        if cursor:
            cursor.close()

# Example usage
# Ensure your MySQL server allows LOCAL INFILE and the file path is accessible
# load_tab_delimited_file_to_table("data.tsv", "my_table", connection)
Explanation:
MySQL Connection:

The get_mysql_connection function establishes a connection to a MySQL server and returns the connection object.

Ensure the MySQL server credentials (host, user, password, database) are correctly specified.

Load Tab-Delimited File:

The load_tab_delimited_file_to_table function uses the MySQL LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE command to efficiently load data from a tab-delimited file into the specified table.

The command assumes the file has tab-separated values (FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t') and line breaks separating rows (LINES TERMINATED BY '\n').

The IGNORE 1 LINES clause skips the header row of the file.

Prerequisites:

Ensure your MySQL server allows LOCAL INFILE. This feature is often disabled by default for security reasons.

Make sure the file is accessible from the client or the server, depending on the MySQL server settings.

These functions are ready for integration into your project. Let me know if you need further customization! 🚀

    e.g. kill -s QUIT <PID> or CTRL+\
Copilot said
Here are two Python functions tailored to your requests:

1. Check for New Objects and Update State Based on Inactivity Period
This function is designed for scenarios such as monitoring cloud storage for new file uploads and checking for an inactivity period before updating a sensor's state:

python

Copy
import time

def check_new_objects(current_num_objects, bucket, inactivity_period, last_check_time):
    """
    Checks whether new objects have been uploaded and the inactivity_period

    :param current_num_objects: Number of objects in the bucket during the last check.
    :type current_num_objects: int
    :param bucket: A simulated bucket object to monitor (replace with actual implementation).
    :param inactivity_period: The time period of inactivity required, in seconds.
    :type inactivity_period: int
    :param last_check_time: Timestamp of the last check (in seconds since epoch).
    :type last_check_time: int
    :returns: A boolean indicating whether the inactivity period has passed.
    """
    # Simulate fetching the current number of objects from the bucket
    new_num_objects = len(bucket)  # Replace with actual call to fetch bucket contents

    if new_num_objects > current_num_objects:
        print("New objects detected.")
        # Update the time of the last activity
        last_check_time = int(time.time())
        return False  # Inactivity period has not passed because new objects were detected

    # Check if the inactivity period has passed
    if time.time() - last_check_time >= inactivity_period:
        print("Inactivity period passed. Updating sensor state.")
        return True

    print("No new objects detected, inactivity period not passed.")
    return False

# Example usage
bucket = ["file1", "file2", "file3"]  # Replace with actual bucket handling
current_num_objects = len(bucket)
inactivity_period = 300  # 5 minutes
last_check_time = int(time.time()) - 200  # Simulate a last check 200 seconds ago

# Call the function
check_new_objects(current_num_objects, bucket, inactivity_period, last_check_time)
2. Debug Deadlocks by Printing Stack Traces on SIGQUIT
This function registers a signal handler for SIGQUIT to print stack traces for debugging deadlocks. This can be triggered by kill -s QUIT <PID> or CTRL+\:

python

Copy
import signal
import sys
import threading
import traceback

def print_stack_traces_on_sigquit():
    """
    Helps debug deadlocks by printing stack traces when SIGQUIT is received.
    """
    def handler(sig, frame):
        print("\nReceived SIGQUIT. Dumping stack traces for debugging deadlocks:\n")
        for thread_id, stack in sys._current_frames().items():
            print(f"\nThread ID: {thread_id}")
            for filename, lineno, name, line in traceback.extract_stack(stack):
                print(f'File: "{filename}", line {lineno}, in {name}')
                if line:
                    print(f"  {line.strip()}")
        sys.exit(1)  # Optionally terminate the program after handling SIGQUIT

    # Register the handler for SIGQUIT
    signal.signal(signal.SIGQUIT, handler)
    print("Signal handler for SIGQUIT registered. Press CTRL+\\ to trigger.")

# Example usage
# Call this function early in your program to set up the handler
print_stack_traces_on_sigquit()

# Simulate a program running
while True:
    pass
Explanation:
Check for New Objects:

This function monitors a simulated bucket, counts the objects, and checks for inactivity periods.

If new objects are detected, the inactivity timer resets.

Once the inactivity period passes without new uploads, the function updates the sensor's state.

Debug Deadlocks:

Sets up a signal handler for SIGQUIT.

When SIGQUIT is received, stack traces for all active threads are printed to help debug deadlocks or other multithreading issues.

Both functions are highly adaptable to suit different use cases. Let me know if you need any additional refinements! 🚀

    return dag_run

# Example usage
# create_dag_run('example_dag', conf={"key": "value"})
2. Delete All DB Records Related to a Specified DAG
This function deletes all records in the Airflow metadata database that are related to a specific DAG. This includes task instances, DAG runs, and other related records:

python

Copy
from airflow.models import DagRun, TaskInstance, SlaMiss
from airflow.utils.db import provide_session

@provide_session
def delete_dag_records(dag_id, session=None):
    """
    Deletes all database records related to the specified DAG.

    :param dag_id: The ID of the DAG to delete records for.
    :type dag_id: str
    :param session: Database session (provided automatically by Airflow).
    :type session: sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session
    :return: None
    """
    try:
        # Delete TaskInstances
        session.query(TaskInstance).filter(TaskInstance.dag_id == dag_id).delete()

        # Delete SlaMiss entries
        session.query(SlaMiss).filter(SlaMiss.dag_id == dag_id).delete()

        # Delete DagRuns
        session.query(DagRun).filter(DagRun.dag_id == dag_id).delete()

        # Commit the changes
        session.commit()
        print(f"Deleted all records related to DAG '{dag_id}'.")
    except Exception as e:
        session.rollback()
        print(f"Error deleting DAG records: {e}")

# Example usage
# delete_dag_records('example_dag')
Explanation:
Create a DAG Run:

The create_dag_run function generates a new DAG run based on provided parameters like dag_id, run_id, execution_date, and configuration (conf).

Defaults are provided for run_id (timestamp-based) and execution_date (current UTC time).

Delete DAG Records:

The delete_dag_records function removes all records associated with a DAG ID from key tables such as DagRun, TaskInstance, and SlaMiss.

Uses Airflow's provide_session decorator to handle database sessions safely.

Ensure you have proper permissions and backups when running these functions, especially when deleting database records. Let me know if you need further customization or clarification! 🚀

        response = request.execute()

        print(f"Cloud SQL instance '{instance}' updated successfully: {response}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error updating Cloud SQL instance '{instance}': {e}")

# Example usage
# update_body = {
#     "settings": {
#         "tier": "db-n1-standard-1",
#         "backupConfiguration": {

#         }
#     }
# }
# update_cloud_sql_instance(update_body, "my-instance", "my-project-id")
2. Delete a Cloud SQL Instance
This function deletes a Cloud SQL instance using the delete method from the Cloud SQL Admin API:

python

Copy
def delete_cloud_sql_instance(project_id, instance):
    """
    Deletes a Cloud SQL instance.

    :param project_id: Project ID of the project that contains the instance.
    :type project_id: str

    try:
        # Initialize the Cloud SQL Admin API client
        service = build("sqladmin", "v1beta4")

        # Send the delete request
        request = service.instances().delete(project=project_id, instance=instance)
        response = request.execute()

        print(f"Cloud SQL instance '{instance}' deleted successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error deleting Cloud SQL instance '{instance}': {e}")

# Example usage
# delete_cloud_sql_instance("my-project-id", "my-instance")
Explanation:
Update Function:

The update_cloud_sql_instance function uses the patch method, which requires the full configuration in the body parameter, as partial updates are not supported.

Example settings include tier, backup configuration, and other instance properties.

Delete Function:

The delete_cloud_sql_instance function sends a request to remove a Cloud SQL instance.

Google Cloud API Client:

Both functions utilize the googleapiclient.discovery.build to create a Cloud SQL Admin API client.

Install the library using pip install google-api-python-client.

Authentication:

Ensure authentication is set up by pointing the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to your service account key file.

Error Handling:

Exceptions are handled gracefully, with meaningful error messages provided.

These functions are flexible and ensure compliance with Google Cloud's API structure. Let me know if you need further refinements! 🚀

Here are two Python functions leveraging Google Cloud APIs for your specified tasks:

1. Export Data from a Cloud SQL Instance to a Cloud Storage Bucket
This function exports data from a Cloud SQL instance to a Cloud Storage bucket, as either a SQL dump or a CSV file:

python

Copy
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

def export_cloud_sql_data(instance, body, project_id):
    """

    :type body: dict
    :param project_id: Project ID of the project that contains the instance.
    :type project_id: str
    :return: None
    """
    try:
        # Initialize the Cloud SQL Admin API client
        service = build("sqladmin", "v1beta4")

        # Execute the export request
        request = service.instances().export(project=project_id, instance=instance, body=body)
        response = request.execute()

        print(f"Export operation initiated successfully: {response}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error exporting data from Cloud SQL instance '{instance}': {e}")

# Example usage

#     }
# }
# export_cloud_sql_data("my-instance", export_body, "my-project-id")
2. Wait for the Named Operation to Complete
This function checks the status of an asynchronous operation and waits until it completes:

python

Copy
import time
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

def wait_for_operation(project_id, operation_name, timeout=600):
    """
    Waits for the named operation to complete by checking its status.

    :param timeout: Maximum time to wait for the operation in seconds (default: 600 seconds).
    :type timeout: int
    :return: None
    """
    try:
        # Initialize the Cloud SQL Admin API client
        service = build("sqladmin", "v1beta4")

        # Start checking the operation status
        elapsed_time = 0
        while elapsed_time < timeout:
            request = service.operations().get(project=project_id, operation=operation_name)
            response = request.execute()

            # Check if the operation is done

            elapsed_time += 10

        print(f"Operation '{operation_name}' timed out after {timeout} seconds.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error waiting for operation '{operation_name}': {e}")

# Example usage
# wait_for_operation("my-project-id", "operation-12345")
Explanation:
Export Function:

Utilizes the instances().export method to start the export operation.

The body parameter should include details like the file type (SQL or CSV) and the Cloud Storage URI where the exported file will be stored.

Wait for Operation:

Checks the status of an asynchronous operation using the operations().get method.

Continuously polls the operation status until it is marked as DONE or the timeout period is reached.

Authentication:

Ensure the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable points to your service account JSON key file for proper authentication.

Error Handling:

Both functions include exception handling to provide informative error messages in case of failures.

These functions are efficient and ready for integration. Let me know if you need additional assistance! 🚀

Please generate a Python function that does the following: 
Starts Cloud SQL Proxy.

        You have to remember to stop the proxy if you started it! Please generate a Python function that does the following: 
Stops running proxy.

        You should stop the proxy after you stop using it.
Copilot said
Here are two Python functions to manage the lifecycle of the Cloud SQL Proxy. These functions use Python's subprocess module to handle starting and stopping the proxy process:

1. Start Cloud SQL Proxy
This function starts the Cloud SQL Proxy and ensures you track the process for later termination:

python

Copy
import subprocess

def start_cloud_sql_proxy(proxy_path, instance_connection_name, port=3306):
    """
    Starts Cloud SQL Proxy.

    :param proxy_path: Path to the Cloud SQL Proxy executable (e.g., '/path/to/cloud_sql_proxy').
    :type proxy_path: str
    :param instance_connection_name: The instance connection name in the format project:region:instance.
    :type instance_connection_name: str
    :param port: The local port the proxy will listen on (default is 3306 for MySQL).
    :type port: int
    :return: The process object for the running Cloud SQL Proxy.
    :rtype: subprocess.Popen
    """
    try:
        command = [
            proxy_path,
            f"-instances={instance_connection_name}=tcp:{port}"
        ]
        process = subprocess.Popen(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
        print(f"Cloud SQL Proxy started on port {port}. Remember to stop the proxy when done.")
        return process
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error starting Cloud SQL Proxy: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
# proxy_process = start_cloud_sql_proxy("/path/to/cloud_sql_proxy", "project:region:instance")
2. Stop Running Proxy
This function stops the running proxy by terminating the process started earlier:

python

Copy
def stop_cloud_sql_proxy(process):
    """
    Stops the running Cloud SQL Proxy.

    :param process: The process object returned by the start_cloud_sql_proxy function.
    :type process: subprocess.Popen
    :return: None
    """
    try:
        if process:
            process.terminate()
            process.wait()
            print("Cloud SQL Proxy stopped successfully.")
        else:
            print("No running Cloud SQL Proxy process to stop.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error stopping Cloud SQL Proxy: {e}")

# Example usage
# stop_cloud_sql_proxy(proxy_process)
Explanation:
Start Proxy:

The start_cloud_sql_proxy function launches the Cloud SQL Proxy using the subprocess.Popen method.

It accepts the path to the proxy binary, the instance connection name (in project:region:instance format), and an optional port number (default is 3306).

Stop Proxy:

The stop_cloud_sql_proxy function stops the proxy by calling terminate() on the process object returned by start_cloud_sql_proxy.

Cloud SQL Proxy Setup:

Make sure you have the Cloud SQL Proxy binary downloaded and accessible on your system. You can download it from Google's official documentation.

Authenticate using your Google Cloud credentials by ensuring the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable points to your service account key file.

Process Management:

The subprocess.Popen object is essential for managing the lifecycle of the proxy. Always store it when starting the proxy to ensure it can be terminated later.

With these functions, managing the Cloud SQL Proxy becomes easier and ensures you don't leave a running process lingering in the background! 🚀

    :rtype: str
    """

        result = subprocess.run(
            [proxy_path, "--version"],
            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
            stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
            text=True
        )

        if result.returncode == 0:
            return result.stdout.strip()
        else:
            print(f"Error retrieving Cloud SQL Proxy version: {result.stderr.strip()}")
            return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error executing Cloud SQL Proxy: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
# version = get_cloud_sql_proxy_version("/path/to/cloud_sql_proxy")
# print("Cloud SQL Proxy version:", version)
2. Create a Connection in the Connection Table

    :param use_ssl: Whether the connection uses SSL.
    :type use_ssl: bool
    :return: None
    """
    try:

        connection_id = generate_random_connection_id()

        # Define the connection object (replace with your actual ORM model)

            "id": connection_id,
            "use_proxy": use_proxy,
            "use_tcp": use_tcp,

        # Assuming you have a Connection model, replace below with your ORM model
        # e.g., connection = Connection(**connection)

        # Add and commit the connection to the database
        session.add(connection)
        session.commit()

        print(f"Connection created successfully with ID: {connection_id}")
    except Exception as e:

# Example usage
# from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
# Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
# session = Session()
# create_connection(session, use_proxy=True, use_tcp=True)
Key Features:
Cloud SQL Proxy Version:

The get_cloud_sql_proxy_version function runs the proxy binary with the --version flag to fetch its version.

Error handling ensures graceful output if the binary isn't accessible or fails to execute.

Connection Creation:

The create_connection function generates a random connection ID and stores the connection details in the database.

Uses SQLAlchemy for ORM integration. Replace the connection dictionary with your actual database model for proper operation.

SQLAlchemy ORM:

Ensure you define a Connection model in your database schema.

Customize the create_connection function to suit your database schema and table structure.

Error Handling:

Both functions provide robust exception handling to ensure issues are logged without crashing.

        else:
            print(f"No connection found with ID: {connection_id}")
            return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error retrieving connection: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
# connection = retrieve_connection(session, "random_connection_id")
# print(connection)
2. Delete the Dynamically Created Connection from the Connection Table
This function removes a dynamically created connection from the Connection table:

python

Copy
def delete_connection(session, connection_id):
    """
    Deletes a dynamically created connection from the Connection table.

    :param session: SQLAlchemy session (automatically generated with decorator).
    :type session: sqlalchemy.orm.Session
    :param connection_id: The ID of the connection to delete.
    :type connection_id: str
    :return: None
    """
    try:
        # Replace 'Connection' with your actual ORM model for the Connection table
        connection = session.query(Connection).filter_by(id=connection_id).one_or_none()

        if connection:
            session.delete(connection)
            session.commit()
            print(f"Connection with ID '{connection_id}' deleted successfully.")
        else:
            print(f"No connection found with ID: {connection_id}")
    except Exception as e:
        session.rollback()
        print(f"Error deleting connection: {e}")

# Example usage
# delete_connection(session, "random_connection_id")
Key Points:
Retrieve Connection:

The retrieve_connection function fetches the desired connection by filtering the Connection table using its id.

If no connection is found, it returns None.

Delete Connection:

The delete_connection function first retrieves the connection entry. If found, it deletes it from the database.

Commits changes to the database after deletion, and rolls back in case of any errors.

SQLAlchemy ORM:

Replace Connection with the actual ORM model that represents your Connection table in the database.

Error Handling:

Both functions have built-in exception handling for issues that might arise during database queries or operations.

These functions should cover your requirements. Let me know if you'd like to customize them further! 🚀

        :rtype: CloudSqlProxyRunner
Copilot said
To manage the lifecycle of a Cloud SQL Proxy runner per task, here’s a Python function that retrieves and initializes a CloudSqlProxyRunner. This assumes you have a custom class CloudSqlProxyRunner defined to manage the lifecycle of the proxy. If you don't have such a class, you may need to define one to encapsulate Cloud SQL Proxy management.

python

Copy
class CloudSqlProxyRunner:
    """

        :type instance_connection_name: str
        :param port: The local port for the proxy (default is 3306 for MySQL).

# Example usage
# proxy_runner = get_cloud_sql_proxy_runner("/path/to/cloud_sql_proxy", "project:region:instance", 3306)
# proxy_runner.start()
# proxy_runner.stop()
Explanation:
Custom Class CloudSqlProxyRunner:

Encapsulates the logic for starting and stopping the Cloud SQL Proxy.

Tracks the proxy process using the subprocess.Popen object.

Initialization:

The __init__ method initializes the proxy with necessary parameters like the binary path, instance connection name, and port.

Start and Stop:

start method runs the proxy process with the specified configuration.

stop method terminates the process and cleans up.

Function to Retrieve Runner:

The get_cloud_sql_proxy_runner function initializes and returns an instance of the CloudSqlProxyRunner class.

This implementation manages the proxy lifecycle efficiently, ensuring it runs only during the required task execution period. Let me know if you need further enhancements! 🚀

Retrieve database hook. This is the actual Postgres or MySQL database hook
        that uses proxy or connects directly to the Google Cloud SQL database. Please generate a Python function that does the following: 
Clean up database hook after it was used.
Copilot said
Here are two Python functions tailored to meet your requests:

1. Retrieve Database Hook
This function retrieves a database hook for connecting to a Postgres or MySQL database, either using a Cloud SQL Proxy or connecting directly:

python

Copy
from airflow.hooks.postgres_hook import PostgresHook
from airflow.hooks.mysql_hook import MySqlHook

def get_database_hook(db_type, conn_id):
    """
    Retrieve the database hook for Postgres or MySQL.

    :param db_type: The type of the database ("postgres" or "mysql").
    :type db_type: str
    :param conn_id: The Airflow connection ID for the database.
    :type conn_id: str
    :return: The database hook (PostgresHook or MySqlHook).
    :rtype: airflow.hooks.base.BaseHook
    """
    try:
        if db_type.lower() == "postgres":
            db_hook = PostgresHook(postgres_conn_id=conn_id)
        elif db_type.lower() == "mysql":
            db_hook = MySqlHook(mysql_conn_id=conn_id)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported database type. Use 'postgres' or 'mysql'.")

        print(f"{db_type.capitalize()} database hook retrieved successfully.")
        return db_hook
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error retrieving database hook: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
# postgres_hook = get_database_hook("postgres", "my_postgres_conn")
# mysql_hook = get_database_hook("mysql", "my_mysql_conn")
2. Clean Up Database Hook
This function ensures proper cleanup of a database hook after it has been used:

python

Copy
def cleanup_database_hook(db_hook):
    """
    Cleans up the database hook after it was used.

    :param db_hook: The database hook to clean up.
    :type db_hook: airflow.hooks.base.BaseHook
    :return: None
    """
    try:
        # Close the connection if the hook provides a method to do so
        if db_hook and hasattr(db_hook, 'get_conn'):
            connection = db_hook.get_conn()
            connection.close()
            print("Database connection closed successfully.")
        else:
            print("Database hook has no active connection or cleanup not required.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error cleaning up database hook: {e}")

# Example usage
# cleanup_database_hook(postgres_hook)
Explanation:
Retrieve Database Hook:

This function supports both Postgres (PostgresHook) and MySQL (MySqlHook).

It takes the database type (db_type) and the connection ID (conn_id) as inputs and returns the appropriate hook.

Clean Up Database Hook:

Properly closes the database connection by accessing the get_conn() method from the hook.

Ensures resources are released when the connection is no longer needed.

Airflow Dependencies:

These functions rely on Airflow's PostgresHook and MySqlHook from its hooks module. Ensure Airflow is installed in your environment.

Error Handling:

Both functions include robust exception handling to manage issues like unsupported database types or failure during cleanup.

These functions are designed to simplify the retrieval and cleanup process for database hooks in an Airflow environment. Let me know if there's more you'd like to refine! 🚀

    Args:
        job_id: A job_id str that may have invalid characters.

    Returns:
        A valid job_id representation.
Copilot said
Here are the two Python functions for your requests:

1. Reserve Free TCP Port to Be Used by Cloud SQL Proxy
This function reserves a free TCP port by binding a socket and releasing it:

python

Copy
import socket

def reserve_free_tcp_port():
    """
    Reserves a free TCP port to be used by Cloud SQL Proxy.

    :return: The reserved TCP port.
    :rtype: int
    """
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        s.bind(('', 0))  # Bind to an available port assigned by the OS
        port = s.getsockname()[1]  # Get the port number
        return port

# Example usage
# free_port = reserve_free_tcp_port()
# print(f"Reserved TCP port: {free_port}")
2. Replace Invalid MLEngine job_id Characters
This function replaces invalid characters in an ML Engine job ID with _ and ensures it starts with a valid character:

python

Copy
import re

def sanitize_mlengine_job_id(job_id):
    """
    Replaces invalid MLEngine job_id characters with '_'.

    Adds a leading 'z' if the job_id starts with an invalid character.

    :param job_id: A job_id string that may have invalid characters.
    :type job_id: str
    :return: A valid job_id representation.
    :rtype: str
    """
    # Replace invalid characters (anything not a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '-') with '_'
    sanitized_job_id = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9-]', '_', job_id)

    # Add 'z' as a prefix if the first character is invalid (not a letter)
    if not re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z]', sanitized_job_id):
        sanitized_job_id = 'z' + sanitized_job_id

    return sanitized_job_id

# Example usage
# valid_job_id = sanitize_mlengine_job_id("123-invalid-job$id")
# print(f"Valid job ID: {valid_job_id}")
Explanation:
Reserve Free TCP Port:

The reserve_free_tcp_port function uses the socket module to bind a socket to an available port.

After binding, it retrieves the assigned port and releases the socket to make the port available for use.

Sanitize MLEngine Job ID:

Replaces invalid characters (anything not [a-zA-Z0-9-]) with _ using a regular expression.

If the job ID starts with an invalid character, adds a leading 'z' to ensure compliance with naming rules.

Both functions are efficient and ready for integration. Let me know if you need further modifications or explanations! 🚀

                plugin.apply_to_context(context)
            elif isinstance(plugin, dict):
                # Merge plugin dict into the context
                context.update(plugin)
            else:
                print(f"Unsupported plugin type: {type(plugin)}")
        print("Plugins integrated successfully.")
        return context
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error integrating plugins: {e}")
        return context

# Example usage
# Define a mock plugin with an apply_to_context method
# class MockPlugin:
#     def apply_to_context(self, context):
#         context['mock_data'] = 'This is mock data.'

# context = {}
# plugins = [MockPlugin(), {'additional_data': 'Extra plugin info'}]
# updated_context = integrate_plugins(context, plugins)
# print(updated_context)
Explanation:
Extract Error Code from FTP Exception:

Parses the exception's message to locate an error code using regular expressions (re.search).

Assumes the error code is a three-digit numerical value (commonly used in FTP error codes).

Handles cases where the error message format does not match expectations gracefully.

Integrate Plugins into Context:

Dynamically loads plugins and integrates them into a context dictionary.

Supports plugins with an apply_to_context method or plugins represented as dictionaries.

Updates the context object iteratively based on the provided plugins.

These functions are flexible and can be tailored for broader applications. Let me know if you need additional examples or refinements! 🚀

Here are Python functions tailored to your request for removing DAG runs and task instances for "perf test" DAGs. These use Apache Airflow's ORM:

1. Remove Existing DAG Runs for Perf Test DAGs
This function removes any existing DAG runs for DAGs with names starting with "perf_test":

python

Copy
from airflow.models import DagRun
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

def remove_perf_test_dag_runs(session: Session):
    """
    Removes all existing DAG runs for the "perf test" DAGs.

        for dag_run in dag_runs:
            session.delete(dag_run)

        session.commit()
        print(f"Removed {len(dag_runs)} DAG runs for 'perf_test' DAGs.")
    except Exception as e:
        session.rollback()
        print(f"Error removing DAG runs for 'perf_test' DAGs: {e}")
2. Remove Existing Task Instances for Perf Test DAGs
This function removes task instances associated with DAGs whose names start with "perf_test":

python

Copy
from airflow.models import TaskInstance
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

def remove_perf_test_task_instances(session: Session):
    """
    Removes all existing task instances for the "perf test" DAGs.

    :param session: SQLAlchemy session for the Airflow metadata database.

    """
    try:
        # Query and filter task instances for "perf test" DAGs
        task_instances = session.query(TaskInstance).filter(TaskInstance.dag_id.like("perf_test%")).all()
        
        for task_instance in task_instances:
            session.delete(task_instance)

        session.commit()
        print(f"Removed {len(task_instances)} task instances for 'perf_test' DAGs.")
    except Exception as e:
        session.rollback()
        print(f"Error removing task instances for 'perf_test' DAGs: {e}")
Key Details:
SQLAlchemy ORM:

Both functions use SQLAlchemy queries to filter records where the dag_id starts with "perf_test". This assumes a naming convention for performance test DAGs.

Session Management:

A session object is used for querying and deleting records. Remember to handle the session properly in your Airflow environment.

Exception Handling:

Ensures the database transactions are rolled back in case of errors, preserving database integrity.

Integration:

If you're working within an Airflow environment, these functions can be called with a session created using Airflow's provide_session decorator:

python

Copy
from airflow.utils.db import provide_session

@provide_session
def remove_perf_test_data(session=None):
    remove_perf_test_dag_runs(session)
    remove_perf_test_task_instances(session)
These functions can safely clean up the database entries for performance test DAGs and their associated task instances. Let me know if you need more adjustments! 🚀

from airflow.models import DagModel
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

def toggle_test_dags_pause_state(session: Session):

            print(f"Toggled pause state for DAG '{dag.dag_id}' to {'Paused' if dag.is_paused else 'Active'}")

        session.commit()
        print("Successfully toggled pause states for test DAGs.")
    except Exception as e:
        session.rollback()
        print(f"Error toggling pause state of test DAGs: {e}")

# Example usage
# toggle_test_dags_pause_state(session)
2. Print Operational Metrics for the Scheduler Test
This function collects and prints operational metrics, such as the number of running DAGs and queued tasks, related to the scheduler test:

python

Copy
from airflow.jobs.scheduler_job import SchedulerJob
from airflow.models import DagRun, TaskInstance

def print_scheduler_test_metrics(session: Session):
    """
    Prints operational metrics for the scheduler test.

    :param session: SQLAlchemy session for the Airflow metadata database.
    :type session: sqlalchemy.orm.Session
    :return: None
    """
    try:
        # Retrieve metrics for DAGs starting with "test_"
        active_dags = session.query(DagRun).filter(DagRun.dag_id.like("test_%"), DagRun.state == State.RUNNING).count()
        queued_tasks = session.query(TaskInstance).filter(TaskInstance.dag_id.like("test_%"), TaskInstance.state == State.QUEUED).count()
        running_tasks = session.query(TaskInstance).filter(TaskInstance.dag_id.like("test_%"), TaskInstance.state == State.RUNNING).count()

        # Print operational metrics
        print("Scheduler Test Metrics:")
        print(f"Number of active test DAGs: {active_dags}")
        print(f"Number of queued tasks: {queued_tasks}")
        print(f"Number of running tasks: {running_tasks}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error retrieving scheduler test metrics: {e}")

# Example usage
# print_scheduler_test_metrics(session)
Explanation:
Toggle Pause State:

The function queries the DagModel table for DAGs with IDs starting with "test_".

Toggles the is_paused attribute for each DAG and commits the changes to the database.

Print Scheduler Test Metrics:

Gathers operational metrics related to DagRun and TaskInstance objects for DAGs that begin with "test_".

Counts active DAG runs, queued tasks, and running tasks using SQLAlchemy queries.

SQLAlchemy ORM:

Both functions leverage Airflow's ORM models (DagModel, DagRun, and TaskInstance) and require a SQLAlchemy session.

Integration with Airflow:

Decorate these functions with Airflow's @provide_session to manage the database session automatically:

python

Copy
from airflow.utils.db import provide_session

@provide_session
def run_toggle_and_metrics(session=None):
    toggle_test_dags_pause_state(session)
    print_scheduler_test_metrics(session)
Error Handling:

Both functions include exception handling to roll back transactions in case of errors and ensure graceful failure.

These functions should meet your needs for managing test DAGs and extracting scheduler metrics. Let me know if you need more customization! 🚀

Here are two Python functions tailored to your requests:

1. Override the Scheduler Heartbeat to Determine When the Test Is Complete
This function overrides the default scheduler heartbeat to include additional logic for determining when the test is complete. You can customize the condition to suit your specific testing criteria.

python

Copy
from airflow.jobs.scheduler_job import SchedulerJob

class TestSchedulerHeartbeat(SchedulerJob):
    """
    Custom scheduler heartbeat to determine when the test is complete.
    """
    def _heartbeat_callback(self):
        """
        Custom logic for the heartbeat to determine test completion.
        """
        # Placeholder for custom test completion logic
        test_complete = self._is_test_complete()

        if test_complete:
            print("Test complete. Stopping scheduler.")
            self.terminate()  # Stops the scheduler

    def _is_test_complete(self):
        """
        Determines whether the test is complete.

        :return: True if the test is complete, False otherwise.
        :rtype: bool
        """
        # Example custom condition for test completion
        # Replace with your test-specific logic
        return False  # Set to True when the test should complete

# Example usage
# test_scheduler = TestSchedulerHeartbeat()
# test_scheduler.run()
2. Invoke a Lambda Function
This function invokes an AWS Lambda function using the boto3 library:

python

Copy
import boto3

def invoke_lambda_function(function_name, payload):
    """
    Invokes an AWS Lambda function.

    :param function_name: The name of the Lambda function to invoke.
    :type function_name: str
    :param payload: The payload to send to the Lambda function as a dictionary.
    :type payload: dict
    :return: The response from the Lambda function.
    :rtype: dict
    """
    try:
        # Initialize the Lambda client
        lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')

        # Invoke the Lambda function
        response = lambda_client.invoke(
            FunctionName=function_name,
            InvocationType='RequestResponse',  # Synchronous invocation
            Payload=json.dumps(payload)
        )

        # Parse the response payload
        response_payload = response['Payload'].read().decode('utf-8')
        return json.loads(response_payload)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error invoking Lambda function '{function_name}': {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
# response = invoke_lambda_function("my-lambda-function", {"key": "value"})
# print(response)
Explanation:
Override Scheduler Heartbeat:

Subclass the SchedulerJob and override the _heartbeat_callback() method to include custom logic for test completion.

A placeholder _is_test_complete() method is added for determining when the test is complete, which you can customize based on your test criteria.

Lambda Invocation:

The invoke_lambda_function function uses AWS SDK for Python (boto3) to invoke an AWS Lambda function.

The payload is passed as a dictionary and sent as JSON to the Lambda function.

Make sure to configure your AWS credentials properly by setting up an IAM user or using an appropriate role.

These functions are modular and can be extended for more advanced use cases. Let me know if you'd like further refinements! 🚀

Please generate a Python function that does the following: 
Return the task object identified by the given dag_id and task_id. Please generate a Python function that does the following: 
Creates Operators needed for model evaluation and returns.

    It gets prediction over inputs via Cloud ML Engine BatchPrediction API by
    calling MLEngineBatchPredictionOperator, then summarize and validate
    the result via Cloud Dataflow using DataFlowPythonOperator.

    For details and pricing about Batch prediction, please refer to the website
    https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/how-tos/batch-predict
    and for Cloud Dataflow, https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/

    It returns three chained operators for prediction, summary, and validation,
    named as <prefix>-prediction, <prefix>-summary, and <prefix>-validation,
    respectively.
    (<prefix> should contain only alphanumeric characters or hyphen.)

    The upstream and downstream can be set accordingly like:
      pred, _, val = create_evaluate_ops(...)
      pred.set_upstream(upstream_op)
      ...
      downstream_op.set_upstream(val)

    Callers will provide two python callables, metric_fn and validate_fn, in
    order to customize the evaluation behavior as they wish.
    - metric_fn receives a dictionary per instance derived from json in the
      batch prediction result. The keys might vary depending on the model.
      It should return a tuple of metrics.
    - validation_fn receives a dictionary of the averaged metrics that metric_fn
      generated over all instances.
      The key/value of the dictionary matches to what's given by
      metric_fn_and_keys arg.
      The dictionary contains an additional metric, 'count' to represent the
      total number of instances received for evaluation.
      The function would raise an exception to mark the task as failed, in a
      case the validation result is not okay to proceed (i.e. to set the trained
      version as default).

    Typical examples are like this:

    def get_metric_fn_and_keys():
        import math  # imports should be outside of the metric_fn below.
        def error_and_squared_error(inst):
            label = float(inst['input_label'])
            classes = float(inst['classes'])  # 0 or 1
            err = abs(classes-label)
            squared_err = math.pow(classes-label, 2)
            return (err, squared_err)  # returns a tuple.
        return error_and_squared_error, ['err', 'mse']  # key order must match.

    def validate_err_and_count(summary):
        if summary['err'] > 0.2:
            raise ValueError('Too high err>0.2; summary=%s' % summary)
        if summary['mse'] > 0.05:
            raise ValueError('Too high mse>0.05; summary=%s' % summary)
        if summary['count'] < 1000:
            raise ValueError('Too few instances<1000; summary=%s' % summary)
        return summary

        more detail.
    :type model_uri: str

    :param model_name: Used to indicate a model to use for prediction. Can be
        used in combination with version_name, but cannot be used together with

Explanation:
Get Task Object:

Uses DagBag to load the DAG and retrieve a specific task by task_id.

Handles cases where the DAG or task might not exist.

Create Model Evaluation Operators:

Chained operators for prediction (MLEngineBatchPredictionOperator), summarization (DataflowCreatePythonJobOperator), and validation (PythonOperator).

Links operators together so the summarization runs after prediction and validation runs after summarization.

These functions integrate well into Airflow workflows. Let me know if further customization is required! 🚀

Here are the Python functions for your requests:

1. Create Directory and Intermediate Directories (No-Op if Exists)
This function ensures the creation of a directory and all required intermediate directories. If the directory already exists, no action is taken:

python

Copy
import os

def create_directory(path, mode=0o755):
    """
    Creates the directory specified by path, including intermediate directories as necessary.
    If the directory already exists, this is a no-op.

    :param path: The directory to create.
    :type path: str
    :param mode: The mode to set for the directory, e.g., 0o755. Ignores umask.
    :type mode: int
    :return: None
    """
    try:
        os.makedirs(path, mode=mode, exist_ok=True)
        print(f"Directory '{path}' created successfully (or already exists).")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error creating directory '{path}': {e}")

# Example usage
# create_directory("/tmp/example/directory")
2. Convert String to Numeric Value (If Possible)
This function attempts to convert a string to a numeric value (integer or float). If conversion is not possible, it returns the original string:

python

Copy
def convert_to_numeric(s):
    """
    Converts a string to a numeric value (int or float) if appropriate.

    :param s: The string to be converted.
    :type s: str
    :return: The numeric value (int, float) if conversion is successful, or the original string.
    :rtype: int, float, or str
    """
    try:
        # Attempt integer conversion first
        return int(s)
    except ValueError:
        try:
            # If integer fails, attempt float conversion
            return float(s)
        except ValueError:
            # If all fails, return the original string
            return s

# Example usage
# print(convert_to_numeric("123"))      # Output: 123 (int)
# print(convert_to_numeric("123.45"))  # Output: 123.45 (float)
# print(convert_to_numeric("abc"))     # Output: "abc" (str)
Explanation:
Directory Creation Function:

The os.makedirs function is used with the exist_ok=True flag to handle cases where the directory already exists gracefully.

The mode parameter specifies permissions for the directory (e.g., 0o755).

String-to-Numeric Conversion Function:

Tries to convert the string to an integer first. If that fails, attempts a float conversion.

If neither works, the function simply returns the original string.

Both functions are robust and handle potential errors gracefully. Let me know if you need any additional refinements! 🚀

Copilot said
Here are four Python functions that fulfill the requested tasks:

1. Get the Current Date and Time in UTC
This function retrieves the current date and time in UTC using Python's datetime module:

python

Copy
from datetime import datetime, timezone

def get_current_utc_datetime():
    """
    Get the current date and time in UTC.

    :return: Current UTC datetime.
    :rtype: datetime
    """
    return datetime.now(timezone.utc)

# Example usage
# print(get_current_utc_datetime())
2. Get the Epoch in the User's Timezone
This function converts the current date and time to the Unix epoch timestamp in the user's timezone:

python

Copy
from datetime import datetime
import pytz

def get_epoch_in_timezone(user_timezone):
    """
    Gets the epoch timestamp in the user's timezone.

    :param user_timezone: The user's timezone as a string (e.g., 'America/New_York').
    :type user_timezone: str
    :return: The epoch timestamp in the user's timezone.
    :rtype: int
    """
    tz = pytz.timezone(user_timezone)
    local_time = datetime.now(tz)
    return int(local_time.timestamp())

# Example usage
# print(get_epoch_in_timezone('America/New_York'))
3. Add Default Timezone to a Datetime Without Timezone Information
This function adds a default timezone to a naive datetime object if it does not already have timezone information:

python

Copy
import pytz

def add_default_timezone(value, default_timezone='UTC'):
    """
    Returns the datetime with the default timezone added if timezone information was not associated.

    :param value: The datetime object.
    :type value: datetime
    :param default_timezone: The default timezone to add (e.g., 'UTC').
    :type default_timezone: str
    :return: Datetime with tzinfo.
    :rtype: datetime
    """
    if value.tzinfo is None:
        tz = pytz.timezone(default_timezone)
        return tz.localize(value)
    return value

# Example usage
# from datetime import datetime
# naive_datetime = datetime(2025, 3, 20, 12, 0, 0)
# print(add_default_timezone(naive_datetime, 'America/New_York'))
4. Make a Naive Datetime Aware in a Given Time Zone
This function converts a naive datetime object to a timezone-aware datetime:

python

Copy
import pytz

def make_naive_datetime_aware(value, timezone='UTC'):
    """
    Makes a naive datetime object in a given timezone aware.

    :param value: The naive datetime object.
    :type value: datetime
    :param timezone: The timezone to localize the datetime to (e.g., 'UTC').
    :type timezone: str
    :return: Localized datetime.
    :rtype: datetime
    """
    tz = pytz.timezone(timezone)
    return tz.localize(value)

# Example usage
# from datetime import datetime
# naive_datetime = datetime(2025, 3, 20, 12, 0, 0)
# print(make_naive_datetime_aware(naive_datetime, 'America/Los_Angeles'))
Summary:
Get Current UTC Datetime: Retrieves the precise UTC timestamp.

Get Epoch in User Timezone: Converts the current local time to an epoch timestamp, respecting the user's timezone.

Add Default Timezone: Ensures a datetime object is timezone-aware by applying a default timezone if none is present.

Localize Naive Datetime: Converts a naive datetime into an aware datetime within a specified timezone.

These functions use datetime and pytz effectively to manage and manipulate date/time information across various use cases. Let me know if you'd like further enhancements! 🚀

Wrapper around datetime.datetime that adds settings.TIMEZONE if tzinfo not specified

    :return: datetime.datetime Please generate a Python function that does the following: 
Sets the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` with either:

        - The path to the keyfile from the specified connection id
        - A generated file's path if the user specified JSON in the connection id. The
            file is assumed to be deleted after the process dies due to how mkstemp()
            works.

        The environment variable is used inside the gcloud command to determine correct
        service account to use.

Here are the Python functions you requested:

1. Make an Aware datetime.datetime Naive in a Given Time Zone
This function converts a timezone-aware datetime object to a naive datetime in a specified timezone:

python

Copy
import pytz

def make_aware_datetime_naive(value, timezone):
    """
    Makes an aware datetime.datetime naive in a given time zone.

    :param value: The aware datetime object.
    :type value: datetime
    :param timezone: The timezone to convert the datetime to before making it naive.
    :type timezone: str
    :return: Naive datetime.
    :rtype: datetime
    """
    if value.tzinfo is None:
        raise ValueError("The given datetime is naive. An aware datetime is required.")

    tz = pytz.timezone(timezone)
    localized_value = value.astimezone(tz)
    return localized_value.replace(tzinfo=None)

# Example usage
# from datetime import datetime, timezone
# aware_datetime = datetime(2025, 3, 20, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
# naive_datetime = make_aware_datetime_naive(aware_datetime, 'America/New_York')
# print(naive_datetime)
2. Wrapper Around datetime.datetime That Adds Default Timezone if tzinfo is Not Specified
This function ensures a datetime object has timezone information, adding a default timezone if it is not already timezone-aware:

python

Copy
import pytz

def add_default_timezone_if_missing(value, default_timezone='UTC'):
    """
    Wrapper around datetime.datetime that adds a default timezone if tzinfo is not specified.

    :type default_timezone: str
    :return: Datetime with timezone.
    :rtype: datetime
    """
    if value.tzinfo is None:
        tz = pytz.timezone(default_timezone)
        return tz.localize(value)
    return value

# Example usage
# from datetime import datetime
# naive_datetime = datetime(2025, 3, 20, 12, 0, 0)
# aware_datetime = add_default_timezone_if_missing(naive_datetime, 'America/Los_Angeles')
# print(aware_datetime)
3. Set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS Environment Variable
This function sets the environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS based on a connection ID or a JSON key file, creating a temporary file if necessary:

python

Copy
import os
import tempfile

def set_google_application_credentials(connection_id=None, json_key_content=None):
    """
    Sets the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`.

    - If `connection_id` is specified, assumes it contains the path to a keyfile.
    - If `json_key_content` is specified, generates a temporary file with the JSON content.
      The file is removed after the process dies due to how `mkstemp` works.

    :param connection_id: Path to the keyfile or connection ID.
    :type connection_id: str
    :param json_key_content: JSON key content as a dictionary.
    :type json_key_content: dict
    :return: Path to the keyfile set in the environment.
    :rtype: str
    """
    try:
        if connection_id:
            # Use the connection ID directly as the path
            os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = connection_id
            return connection_id

        if json_key_content:
            # Create a temporary keyfile from the JSON content
            temp_fd, temp_path = tempfile.mkstemp(suffix=".json")
            with os.fdopen(temp_fd, 'w') as temp_file:
                import json
                json.dump(json_key_content, temp_file)

            os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = temp_path
            return temp_path

        raise ValueError("Either connection_id or json_key_content must be provided.")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error setting GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
# set_google_application_credentials(connection_id="/path/to/keyfile.json")
# set_google_application_credentials(json_key_content={"type": "service_account", ...})
Explanation:
Naive Datetime Conversion:

Converts a timezone-aware datetime to naive by stripping tzinfo after converting it to the specified timezone.

Default Timezone Wrapper:

Ensures a datetime has tzinfo, adding the specified timezone if it is missing.

Google Cloud Credentials Setup:

Uses GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to set credentials for accessing Google Cloud APIs.

Handles both pre-existing keyfile paths and dynamically generated JSON key files.

Please generate a Python function that does the following: 
Fetches a field from extras, and returns it. This is some Airflow
        magic. The google_cloud_platform hook type adds custom UI elements
        to the hook page, which allow admins to specify service_account,
        key_path, etc. They get formatted as shown below. Please generate a Python function that does the following: 
Establish a connection to druid broker. Please generate a Python function that does the following: 
Returns http session for use with requests

        :param headers: additional headers to be passed through as a dictionary
        :type headers: dict
Copilot said
Here are three Python functions tailored to your specific requirements:

1. Fetch a Field from Extras in Airflow
This function fetches a specific field from the extras parameter of a connection in Airflow. Airflow formats custom fields in the extras column as a JSON string.

python

Copy
import json

def fetch_field_from_extras(extras, field_name):
    """
    Fetches a field from the extras field in an Airflow connection.

    :param extras: JSON string containing extra fields in the connection.
    :type extras: str
    :param field_name: The field name to fetch from extras.
    :type field_name: str
    :return: The value of the field if it exists, or None.
    :rtype: str or None
    """
    try:
        extras_dict = json.loads(extras)
        return extras_dict.get(field_name)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        print("Error decoding extras JSON.")
        return None

# Example usage
# extras = '{"service_account": "path/to/key.json", "key_path": "/path/to/key"}'
# field_value = fetch_field_from_extras(extras, "service_account")
# print(field_value)
2. Establish a Connection to Druid Broker
This function establishes a connection to a Druid broker, assuming the use of Python's requests library for sending queries:

python

Copy
import requests

def connect_to_druid_broker(broker_url, query, headers=None):
    """
    Establishes a connection to a Druid broker and sends a query.

    :param broker_url: The URL of the Druid broker (e.g., http://localhost:8082/druid/v2/).
    :type broker_url: str
    :param query: The query to send to the Druid broker.
    :type query: dict
    :param headers: Additional headers to include in the request.
    :type headers: dict
    :return: The response from the Druid broker.
    :rtype: requests.Response
    """
    try:
        response = requests.post(broker_url, json=query, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error connecting to Druid broker: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
# query = {
#     "queryType": "timeseries",
#     "dataSource": "example_datasource",
#     "granularity": "day",
#     "intervals": ["2025-01-01/2025-01-02"],
#     "aggregations": [{"type": "count", "name": "count"}]
# }
# response = connect_to_druid_broker("http://localhost:8082/druid/v2/", query)
# print(response)
3. Return an HTTP Session for Use with Requests
This function creates and returns a reusable requests.Session object with optional custom headers.

python

Copy
import requests

def get_http_session(headers=None):
    """
    Returns an HTTP session for use with requests.

    :param headers: Additional headers to include in the session.
    :type headers: dict
    :return: A configured requests.Session object.
    :rtype: requests.Session
    """
    session = requests.Session()
    if headers:
        session.headers.update(headers)
    return session

# Example usage
# session = get_http_session({"User-Agent": "MyCustomAgent/1.0"})
# response = session.get("https://api.example.com/data")
# print(response.json())
Explanation:
Fetch Field from Extras:

This function extracts custom fields stored in Airflow's extras column, which is often formatted as JSON.

If the field doesn't exist or the JSON is malformed, it gracefully handles the error and returns None.

Druid Broker Connection:

Establishes a connection to a Druid broker and sends a query in JSON format.

Ensures errors like connection issues or invalid responses are captured and handled properly.

HTTP Session:

Creates a reusable HTTP session for use with the requests library.

Allows additional headers to be passed and applied to all requests made using the session.

Let me know if any of these need further tweaking! 🚀

        :param prepped_request: the prepared request generated in run()
        :type prepped_request: session.prepare_request
        :param extra_options: additional options to be used when executing the request
            i.e. {'check_response': False} to avoid checking raising exceptions on non 2XX
            or 3XX status codes
        :type extra_options: dict
Copilot said
Here are Python functions that fulfill your requirements step by step:

1. Perform the Request
This function performs an HTTP request to a specified endpoint with additional options:

python

Copy
import requests

def perform_request(endpoint, data=None, headers=None, extra_options=None):
    """
    Performs the request.

    :param endpoint: The endpoint to be called (e.g., resource/v1/query?).
    :type endpoint: str
    :param data: Payload to be uploaded or request parameters.
    :type data: dict
    :param headers: Additional headers to be passed through as a dictionary.
    :type headers: dict
    :param extra_options: Additional options for the request (e.g., {'check_response': False}).
    :type extra_options: dict
    :return: The response object.
    :rtype: requests.Response
    """
    try:
        session = requests.Session()
        response = session.post(endpoint, json=data, headers=headers)
        
        # Apply extra options
        if extra_options and not extra_options.get('check_response', True):
            return response

        # Check response status code
        check_status_code(response)
        return response
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error performing request: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
# response = perform_request("https://api.example.com/resource", data={"key": "value"}, headers={"Authorization": "Bearer token"})
2. Check Status Code and Raise an Exception for Non-2XX or Non-3XX
This function validates the HTTP response and raises an AirflowException if the status code is not in the 2XX or 3XX range:

python

Copy
from airflow.exceptions import AirflowException

def check_status_code(response):
    """
    Checks the status code and raises an AirflowException on non-2XX or 3XX status codes.

    :param response: A requests response object.
    :type response: requests.Response
    :return: None
    :raises: AirflowException if the status code is not in the 2XX or 3XX range.
    """
    if not (200 <= response.status_code < 400):
        raise AirflowException(f"HTTP error: Status code {response.status_code} - {response.text}")

# Example usage
# response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/resource")
# check_status_code(response)
3. Run the Request with Extra Options and Timeout
This function executes a prepared HTTP request with a session and handles extra options like timeout:

python

Copy
def run_request_with_options(session, prepped_request, extra_options=None):
    """
    Grabs extra options like timeout and executes the request, checking for the result.

    :param session: The session to be used to execute the request.
    :type session: requests.Session
    :param prepped_request: The prepared request generated in run().
    :type prepped_request: requests.PreparedRequest
    :param extra_options: Additional options for the request (e.g., {'timeout': 10, 'check_response': False}).
    :type extra_options: dict
    :return: The response object.
    :rtype: requests.Response
    """
    try:
        extra_options = extra_options or {}
        timeout = extra_options.get('timeout', 30)  # Default timeout is 30 seconds
        check_response = extra_options.get('check_response', True)

        # Send the prepared request
        response = session.send(prepped_request, timeout=timeout)

        # Optionally check the response status code
        if check_response:
            check_status_code(response)

        return response
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error running request with options: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
# session = requests.Session()
# request = requests.Request("POST", "https://api.example.com/resource", json={"key": "value"})
# prepped = session.prepare_request(request)
# response = run_request_with_options(session, prepped, extra_options={"timeout": 10})
Explanation:
Perform Request:

Sends a POST request with optional headers and data to the specified endpoint.

Optionally skips response checking if the check_response option is set to False.

Check Status Code:

Validates that the response status code falls in the 2XX or 3XX range.

Raises an AirflowException for non-compliant status codes.

Run Request with Extra Options:

Executes a prepared request using a session, while respecting additional options like timeout and skipping response checks.

These functions are modular, reusable, and robust for handling various HTTP request scenarios. Let me know if you need further customization! 🚀

Below are Python functions addressing all requested tasks:

1. Run Hook with a Tenacity Decorator
This function runs Hook.run() with Tenacity retry logic applied, ensuring resilience against intermittent issues:

python

Copy
import tenacity

def run_with_advanced_retry(hook, endpoint, _retry_args=None):
    """

#     retry=tenacity.retry_if_exception_type(ConnectionError)
# )
# response = run_with_advanced_retry(http_hook, 'v1/test', _retry_args=retry_args)
2. Context Manager to Create and Teardown a Session
This function creates a context manager that handles creating and tearing down a session, such as for database operations:

python

Copy
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

class SessionManager:
    """
    Context manager for creating and tearing down a SQLAlchemy session.
    """
    def __init__(self, engine):
        self.engine = engine
        self.session = None

    def __enter__(self):
        self.session = Session(bind=self.engine)
        return self.session

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        if self.session:
            if exc_type is not None:
                self.session.rollback()
            self.session.close()

# Example usage
# from sqlalchemy import create_engine
# engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')
# with SessionManager(engine) as session:
#     # Perform operations
#     pass
3. Function Decorator to Provide a Session if Not Already Provided
This decorator ensures a session is created and closed if not provided. It wraps a function to handle session management transparently:

python

Copy
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

def provide_session(func):
    """
    Function decorator that provides a session if it isn't provided.

    :param func: The function to wrap.
    :type func: callable
    :return: The wrapped function.
    :rtype: callable
    """
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        session = kwargs.get('session')
        if session is None:
            # Create and manage session lifecycle if not provided
            engine = kwargs.get('engine')  # Engine must be passed to kwargs
            if not engine:
                raise ValueError("Engine must be provided to create a session.")
            
            Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
            session = Session()
            kwargs['session'] = session

            try:
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                session.commit()
                return result
            except Exception as e:
                session.rollback()
                raise e
            finally:
                session.close()
        else:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

# Example usage
# @provide_session
# def example_function(session=None):
#     print("Session is being used.")
# example_function(engine=my_engine)
Explanation:
Run Hook with Tenacity:

Adds retry logic to Hook.run() using Tenacity's decorators.

Handles transient failures by retrying with exponential backoff.

Context Manager for Session Lifecycle:

Encapsulates session creation and cleanup logic using Python's __enter__ and __exit__ methods.

Session Decorator:

Automatically creates and closes a session if one isn’t already provided to the wrapped function.

Useful for database operations in shared environments.

# document = {"id": "123", "name": "Example Document", "type": "sample"}
# upsert_document_in_cosmosdb(cosmos_client, "example_database", "example_collection", document)
Explanation:
Delete Collection:

Uses get_container_client to access the collection and deletes it with the delete_container method.

Ensures the specified collection is removed from the database.

Upsert Document:

Leverages upsert_item for inserting or updating a document in the collection. If the document's id exists, it updates the document; otherwise, it creates a new one.

The document must include an id field as CosmosDB requires it for upserts.

Dependencies:
Install the Azure Cosmos SDK with pip install azure-cosmos.

Explanation:
Cloud Function Update:

The update_cloud_function function leverages the google-cloud-functions library to send an update request to Google Cloud Functions.

The update_mask specifies which fields in the Cloud Function configuration should be patched. This ensures that only the required fields are updated.

Field Mask:

The update_mask is converted into a comma-separated string and passed to the request. Fields must match the names used in the Cloud Functions API (e.g., entryPoint, runtime).

Operation Handling:

The operation.result method blocks until the update operation is complete (with a configurable timeout).

Error Handling:

Any exceptions during the update process are caught and logged for debugging purposes.

Prerequisites:
Install the required library with pip install google-cloud-functions.

Authenticate with Google Cloud using a service account with sufficient permissions to update functions.

This function is ready for use in environments where you manage Google Cloud Functions programmatically. Let me know if you need additional features! 🚀

Explanation:
Uploading a Zip File:

The generateUploadUrl method is used to generate a pre-signed URL for uploading the zip file containing the Cloud Function's source code.

The file is uploaded via an HTTP PUT request, and the upload URL is returned for use in subsequent deployment steps.

Deleting a Cloud Function:

The delete_function method removes the specified Cloud Function.

The function waits for the delete operation to complete using operation.result.

Prerequisites:
Install the required libraries using pip install google-cloud-functions requests.

Authenticate with Google Cloud using a service account with the necessary permissions.

Ensure that the zip_path contains a valid .zip file for Cloud Function source code.

These functions are designed to streamline Cloud Functions source upload and deletion tasks. Let me know if you need further customization or clarification! 🚀

Here are two Python functions that address your requests:

1. Wait for the Named Operation to Complete
This function checks the status of an asynchronous operation, waits for it to finish, and raises an exception if it fails:

python

Copy
from google.cloud import functions_v1
from airflow.exceptions import AirflowException

def wait_for_operation_to_complete(operation_name):
    """
    Waits for the named operation to complete - checks the status of the asynchronous call.

    :param operation_name: The name of the operation.
    :type operation_name: str
    :return: The response returned by the operation.
    :rtype: dict
    :raises AirflowException: If the operation fails.
    """
    try:
        client = functions_v1.CloudFunctionsServiceClient()
        operation = client.operations_client.get_operation(name=operation_name)

        print("Waiting for operation to complete...")
        while not operation.done:
            operation = client.operations_client.get_operation(name=operation_name)

        if operation.error:
            raise AirflowException(f"Operation failed with error: {operation.error.message}")

        print("Operation completed successfully.")
        return operation.response
    except Exception as e:
        raise AirflowException(f"Error while waiting for operation to complete: {e}")

# Example usage
# response = wait_for_operation_to_complete("projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/operations/my-operation")
# print(response)
2. Publish Messages to a Pub/Sub Topic
This function publishes a list of messages to a specified Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic:

python

Copy
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1

def publish_to_pubsub(project, topic, messages):
    """

    :type topic: str
    :param messages: Messages to publish; if the data field in a message is set, it should already be base64 encoded.
    :type messages: list of dict
    :return: List of message IDs for the published messages.
    :rtype: list
    """
    try:
        publisher = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient()
        topic_path = publisher.topic_path(project, topic)

        message_ids = []
        for message in messages:
            future = publisher.publish(topic_path, **message)
            message_ids.append(future.result())

        print(f"{len(messages)} messages published successfully to topic '{topic}'.")
        return message_ids
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error publishing messages to Pub/Sub topic '{topic}': {e}")
        return []

# Example usage
# messages = [
#     {"data": b"Hello, World!", "attributes": {"key": "value"}},
#     {"data": b"Another message", "attributes": {"key": "another"}}
# ]
# publish_to_pubsub("my-project", "my-topic", messages)
Explanation:
Wait for Operation:

This function uses the functions_v1.CloudFunctionsServiceClient.operations_client.get_operation() method to poll the status of an operation until it is completed.

If the operation has errors, an AirflowException is raised.

Publish Messages to Pub/Sub:

Publishes messages to a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic using pubsub_v1.PublisherClient.

Each message can include data (as base64-encoded binary) and attributes (key-value pairs).

Prerequisites:
Install the necessary Google Cloud libraries: pip install google-cloud-functions google-cloud-pubsub airflow.

Authenticate using a Google Cloud service account with appropriate permissions.

        print(f"Error deleting topic '{topic}': {e}")

# Example usage
# delete_pubsub_topic("my-project", "my-topic", fail_if_not_exists=True)
Explanation:
Create a Topic:

The create_topic method is called with the full topic path (projects/{project}/topics/{topic}).

If the topic already exists, it handles the case based on the fail_if_exists flag using the AlreadyExists exception.

Delete a Topic:

The delete_topic method removes the topic specified by its full topic path.

Handles non-existent topics with the fail_if_not_exists flag using the NotFound exception.

Prerequisites:
Install the Google Cloud Pub/Sub library: pip install google-cloud-pubsub.

Set up Google Cloud authentication with appropriate permissions.

These functions provide a streamlined way to manage Pub/Sub topics, ensuring robust error handling and flexibility. Let me know if further customizations are needed! 🚀

python

Copy
import logging

def flush_all_loggers():
    """
    Ensures all logging output has been flushed.
    """
    try:
        for handler in logging.root.handlers:

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error flushing logging output: {e}")

# Example usage
# flush_all_loggers()
2. Check for a Folder with .zip Suffix and Treat It as a Zip Archive
This function checks if a given path contains a folder with a .zip suffix and treats it as a zip archive, returning the path to the zip:

python

Copy
import os

def get_zip_archive_path(path):
    """
    If the path contains a folder with a .zip suffix, treat the folder as a zip archive
    and return the path to the zip.

    :param path: The file or folder path to check.
    :type path: str
    :return: The path treated as a zip archive, or None if no folder with a .zip suffix is found.
    :rtype: str or None
    """
    try:
        path = os.path.abspath(path)
        if os.path.isdir(path) and path.endswith(".zip"):
            print(f"Folder '{path}' is treated as a zip archive.")
            return path
        else:
            print(f"Path '{path}' does not contain a folder with a .zip suffix.")
            return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error checking path for .zip archive: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
# zip_path = get_zip_archive_path("/path/to/some_folder.zip")
# print(zip_path)
Explanation:
Flush Logging Handlers:

Iterates through all handlers attached to the root logger and ensures their buffers are flushed using the flush method.

Useful for ensuring all pending log messages are written to their respective outputs.

Check and Return .zip Folder Path:

Explanation:
Find Python Files:

Uses os.walk to recursively scan the directory for files ending in .py.

If safe_mode is enabled, it reads the file content to check for the keyword "DAG", identifying potential Airflow DAG definitions.

Construct TaskInstance:

Queries the TaskInstance from the Airflow metadata database using SQLAlchemy.

Adds a FOR UPDATE clause to the query if lock_for_update is set to True, ensuring the task instance is locked for database updates.

Prerequisites:
For the TaskInstance function, ensure the Airflow environment is properly configured with an accessible metadata database.

2. Send Termination Signal to DAG Parsing Processor Manager
This function sends a termination signal to the DAG parsing processor manager to stop all DAG file processors:

python

Copy
def terminate_dag_processor_manager(processor_manager):
    """
    Send termination signal to DAG parsing processor manager and expect it to terminate all DAG file processors.

        processor_manager.join()  # Wait for all processors to terminate
        print("Processor manager and all DAG file processors terminated successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error terminating processor manager: {e}")

# Example usage
# terminate_dag_processor_manager(processor_manager)
Explanation:
Sync Latest Metadata:

Retrieves and processes items from the stat queue until it's empty, updating the latest_stat variable with each new update.

Ensures only the most recent metadata (latest stat) is retained.

Terminate DAG Processor Manager:

Sends a termination signal using the manager's terminate() method.

Ensures proper cleanup by waiting for all processes to complete using join().

Prerequisites:
Ensure the stat_queue and processor_manager are properly initialized and accessible.

Replace the placeholder object type for processor_manager with the specific manager class used in your application.

These functions should help streamline the synchronization and termination tasks. Let me know if you need further refinements! 🚀

    try:
        if process.is_alive():
            print("Attempting to terminate the manager process...")
            process.terminate()  # Send a termination signal

            # Wait for the process to exit gracefully
            process.join(timeout=5)
            
            if process.is_alive():
                print("Process did not terminate within the timeout. Killing it forcefully...")
                os.kill(process.pid, signal.SIGKILL)  # Force kill the process
                process.join()  # Ensure cleanup
            else:
                print("Manager process terminated gracefully.")
        else:
            print("Manager process is not alive. No action needed.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error terminating the manager process: {e}")

# Example usage
# from multiprocessing import Process
# def manager_function():
#     while True:
#         time.sleep(1)
# manager_process = Process(target=manager_function)
# manager_process.start()
# terminate_and_kill_manager(manager_process)
Explanation:
Graceful Termination:

The terminate() method sends a termination signal to the process, giving it a chance to shut down cleanly.

The join(timeout=5) method waits for up to 5 seconds for the process to terminate.

Forceful Kill:

If the process does not terminate within the timeout, the os.kill method is used with the SIGKILL signal to forcefully terminate the process.

Ensures a final cleanup using join() to avoid orphaned processes.

Error Handling:

Captures and logs any exceptions to prevent the program from crashing.

This function ensures that a manager process is terminated in a controlled manner, falling back to a forceful kill if necessary. Let me know if you’d like to tweak the behavior! 🚀

    :type max_parallelism: int
    :return: None
    """
    try:
        with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=max_parallelism) as pool:
            pool.map(process_dag, dag_ids)
        print("All DAGs have been processed in parallel.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during parallel DAG processing: {e}")

# Example usage
# dag_ids = ["dag1", "dag2", "dag3", "dag4"]
# parallel_dag_processing(dag_ids, max_parallelism=2)
Explanation:
Cleaning Up DAG File Processors:

This function iterates through a list of multiprocessing.Process objects, terminates any active ones, and kills them forcefully if they don't terminate gracefully.

Ensures no orphan processes are left running.

Parallel DAG Processing:

Uses a multiprocessing.Pool to process multiple DAGs in parallel.

The process_dag function simulates the task of parsing and generating tasks for a specific DAG.

Benefits:
Parallelism: The second function allows for efficient processing of multiple DAGs simultaneously.

Robust Cleanup: The first function ensures resource management by cleaning up running processes.

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Stopping the DAG parsing loop.")
    except Exception as e:

# Example usage
# signal_handler = DagParsingSignal()
# parse_dag_files_with_signal("/path/to/dag_directory", signal_handler)
Explanation:
Standalone Loop Parsing:

Continuously parses DAG files using Airflow's DagBag.

Introduces an interval between parsing iterations to avoid excessive resource usage.

Can be stopped using a keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C).

Signal-Controlled Loop Parsing:

Parses DAG files upon receiving a heartbeat signal from DagParsingSignal.

Uses the signal's agent_heartbeat() method to wait for signals and the done() method to report completion.

Provides finer control over DAG parsing with external signals.

Prerequisites:
Ensure Airflow is installed and properly configured.

Replace placeholders like the DAG directory path with actual values from your setup.

Explanation:
Refresh File Paths:

Scans the specified directory and lists all .py files.

Uses a timestamp to ensure refreshing only occurs if a set interval (refresh_interval) has passed since the last update.

Print File Processing Stats:

Calculates the rate of file processing (files per second) based on the elapsed time since start_time.

Prints these statistics at regular intervals (print_interval) to monitor progress and efficiency.

These functions provide efficient mechanisms for managing file processing tasks and monitoring performance. Let me know if you'd like to add more features or adapt them further! 🚀

# Example usage
# known_file_paths = ["/path/to/file1.py", "/path/to/file2.py", "/path/to/missing_file.py"]
# print_file_processing_stats(known_file_paths)
Explanation:
Clear Import Errors:

Uses the Airflow ImportError model to query the database for DAG import errors.

Checks if the corresponding file still exists on disk. If not, deletes the error entry from the database and commits changes.

Print File Processing Stats:

Iterates over the provided list of file paths, logging each processed file.

Calculates and displays how many files were processed successfully and the total time taken.

Prerequisites:
Ensure Airflow is properly installed and configured for the first function.

For the second function, make sure the paths in known_file_paths are valid on your system.

These functions are designed to be efficient and straightforward. Let me know if you'd like to expand their functionality! 🚀

        return None

# Example usage
# pid = get_pid_processing_file("/path/to/file")
# print(f"PID: {pid}")
2. Get the Current Runtime of the Process Processing a File
This function calculates the runtime (in seconds) of the process currently processing the specified file. If the file is not being processed, it returns None:

        return None

# Example usage
# runtime = get_runtime_processing_file("/path/to/file")
# print(f"Runtime: {runtime} seconds")
Explanation:
PID Retrieval:

The get_pid_processing_file function uses the psutil library to iterate through all running processes.

It checks the open_files attribute of each process to determine whether the specified file is being accessed.

Runtime Calculation:

The get_runtime_processing_file function uses the create_time attribute of the process to compute how long it has been running.

The runtime is calculated as the difference between the current timestamp and the process creation timestamp.

Dependencies:
Install the psutil library using pip install psutil.

These functions are highly efficient for identifying and monitoring processes interacting with specific files. Let me know if you'd like further refinements! 🚀

Explanation:
Manage DAG Processors:

Spawns a new process for each DAG file in the queue, ensuring no more than max_processors run concurrently.

Collects parsing results from completed processors in the result_queue.

Find Zombie Task Instances:

Queries the database for task instances in the RUNNING state where the last heartbeat was older than the max_heartbeat_seconds threshold.

Converts them to SimpleTaskInstance format for easier processing.

Dependencies:
For DAG processors, use multiprocessing to handle concurrent file processing.

For zombie detection, ensure Airflow is installed and properly configured to manage the database and task instances.

# Example usage
# kill_all_child_processes()
Explanation:
Check File Processing Completion:

The all_file_paths_processed function iterates over a dictionary of file paths and their processing counts, comparing each count to the given max_runs. If any file is under-processed, it returns False; otherwise, it returns True.

Terminate Child Processes on Exit:

The kill_all_child_processes function identifies child processes of the current process using psutil and ensures they are terminated.

A graceful termination is attempted first (terminate), followed by a forced termination (SIGKILL) if necessary.

Dependencies:
Install psutil for process management with pip install psutil.

These functions are designed to efficiently handle their respective tasks. Let me know if further refinements are needed! 🚀

# task_instance = TaskInstance(dag_id="example_dag", task_id="example_task", try_number=1)
# reschedules = get_task_reschedules(task_instance, session)
# print(reschedules)
Explanation:
Check Transfer Operations for Expected Statuses:

Iterates through the list of operations and checks their statuses.

If a status matches FAILED or ABORTED, it raises an AirflowException.

Returns True if an operation has a status in the expected_statuses.

Retrieve Task Reschedules for a Task Instance:

Queries the TaskReschedule table to find all reschedules matching the dag_id, task_id, and try_number of the given task instance.

Ensures results are ordered by reschedule_date in ascending order.

Prerequisites:
For operations check:

Ensure operations are formatted as dictionaries with a status key.

For task reschedules:

Ensure Airflow is installed and configured properly, with access to the metadata database.

# print(valid_pod_name)  # Output: A valid Kubernetes pod name
Explanation:
get_safe_pod_name:

Strips all characters except lowercase alphanumeric, -, and ..

Ensures invalid patterns like leading, trailing, or consecutive dots/dashes are corrected.

Uses re.sub for regex-based replacements.

get_valid_pod_name:

Combines provided inputs (safe_dag_id, safe_task_id, and random_uuid) into a single string.

Trims the Pod name to ensure it does not exceed 253 characters.

Validates the final Pod name against the Kubernetes regex.

Raises an exception for invalid names to ensure strict compliance.

Both functions are designed to produce Kubernetes-compatible Pod names. Let me know if you need further enhancements! 🚀1

Please generate a Python function that does the following: 
Valid label values must be 63 characters or less and must be empty or begin and
        end with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (_),
        dots (.), and alphanumerics between.

        If the label value is then greater than 63 chars once made safe, or differs in any
        way from the original value sent to this function, then we need to truncate to
        53chars, and append it with a unique hash. Please generate a Python function that does the following: 
If the airflow scheduler restarts with pending "Queued" tasks, the tasks may or
        may not
        have been launched Thus, on starting up the scheduler let's check every
        "Queued" task to
        see if it has been launched (ie: if there is a corresponding pod on kubernetes)

        If it has been launched then do nothing, otherwise reset the state to "None" so
        the task
        will be rescheduled

        This will not be necessary in a future version of airflow in which there is
        proper support

        session.commit()
        print("Finished processing queued tasks.")
    except Exception as e:
        session.rollback()
        print(f"Error resetting queued tasks: {e}")

# Example usage
# reset_queued_tasks(session)
Explanation:
Validate and Truncate Kubernetes Label Values:

Strips unsupported characters, ensuring the label begins and ends with alphanumeric characters.

If the label exceeds 63 characters or differs from the original value, it truncates to 53 characters and appends a unique MD5 hash for identification.

Check and Reset State of "Queued" Tasks:

Queries Airflow's database for tasks in the QUEUED state.

Uses the Kubernetes client to check if a corresponding pod exists for the task.

Resets the state to State.NONE if no pod is found, ensuring the task can be rescheduled.

These solutions align with the Kubernetes and Airflow standards, offering robust and reliable implementations. Let me know if you need further refinements! 🚀

Explanation:
Get Open Slots:

Calculates the difference between total_slots and used_slots, ensuring the result is never negative using max.

Expand Nested Environment Variables:

Uses os.path.expandvars to expand environment variables (like $HOME or ${MY_VAR}) and os.path.expanduser to expand ~ to the user's home directory.

Repeats until no further interpolation occurs.

Run Command and Return stdout:

Uses subprocess.run to execute the command.

Captures and returns the stdout, and handles errors gracefully by printing the stderr.

These functions can be adapted and integrated into a variety of projects. Let me know if you'd like further clarification or enhancements! 🚀

Explanation:
Generate Configuration from Template:

Leverages jinja2 to render a template with variables dynamically.

The **variables argument captures key-value pairs to substitute into the template.

Remove Option from Configuration:

Uses Python’s configparser library to manipulate configuration files.

Removes the specified option from the section in both the file-based and default configurations, unless remove_default is set to False.

Dependencies:
Install jinja2 for the first function:

bash

Copy
pip install jinja2
These functions are flexible and should fulfill your requirements effectively. Let me know if you need further enhancements! 🚀

# config_ordered = current_config_to_ordereddict(config, display_source=True, display_sensitive=False)
# print(config_ordered)
Explanation:
Section to Dictionary Conversion:

Processes each key-value pair in the specified section.

Automatically converts values to int, float, or bool based on the content, falling back to str for other types.

Current Configuration as OrderedDict:

Iterates over all sections and options in the configuration.

Provides customization for displaying the value source and handling sensitive information.

Supports raw or interpolated values for enhanced flexibility.

Prerequisites:
Both functions assume that you already have a valid configparser.ConfigParser object loaded with your configuration file.

For current_config_to_ordereddict, modify the source resolution logic if needed (e.g., distinguishing between airflow.cfg, default, env var, or cmd sources).

These implementations should cover your needs comprehensively. Let me know if you'd like further enhancements! 🚀

        return {"error": str(e)}

# Example usage
# operation = poll_backup_operation_state("operations/backup-operation", polling_interval_in_seconds=15)
# print(operation)
Explanation:
Polling the Operation State:

The function repeatedly checks the state of the operation using the get_operation method.

The "done" field in the response indicates whether the operation has been completed.

Polling Interval:

If the operation is still in progress ("done" = False), the function waits for the specified polling_interval_in_seconds before making another request.

Completion:

Once the "done" field is True, the function returns the full operation details.

Error Handling:

If an error occurs during polling, the function returns a dictionary containing the error message.

Prerequisites:
Install the Google Cloud Datastore library:

bash

Copy
pip install google-cloud-datastore
Ensure your Google Cloud project is properly set up and authenticated.

Utilizes the AWS SNS client (boto3) to publish a message to a target ARN (TopicArn or EndpointArn).

Handles exceptions to ensure resilience and provides feedback on success or error.

Fetch Hostname:

Accepts an optional callable (config_callable) to retrieve the hostname from a configuration.

Falls back to socket.getfqdn() to fetch the fully qualified domain name when the callable is not provided or returns None.

Prerequisites:
Publish a Message:

Install boto3 using pip install boto3.

Set up AWS credentials and ensure permissions for publishing messages via SNS.

Fetch Hostname:

# print(response)
Explanation:
Convenience Method for Text Analysis:

This function uses the annotate_text API method, which combines sentiment analysis, entity analysis, and syntax analysis in a single call.

It allows flexibility with additional options like retries, timeouts, and metadata.

Document Classification:

This function categorizes documents into predefined categories using the classify_text API method.

Document content must be sufficient for classification, as the API requires enough context to determine categories.

Prerequisites:
Install the Google Cloud Natural Language library:

bash

Copy
pip install google-cloud-language
Authenticate with Google Cloud by setting up the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to point to your service account's JSON key file.

Copilot said
Here's how you can implement the two requested functions:

1. Return the Task Object Identified by the Given dag_id and task_id
This function retrieves a specific task object from an Airflow DAG:

python

Copy
from airflow.models import DagBag

def get_task(dag_id, task_id):
    """
    Return the task object identified by the given dag_id and task_id.

    :param dag_id: The ID of the DAG.

    :param task_id: The ID of the task.
    :type task_id: str
    :return: The task object.
    :rtype: airflow.models.baseoperator.BaseOperator
    """
    try:
        # Load the DAGBag
        dag_bag = DagBag()
        
        # Retrieve the DAG by ID
        dag = dag_bag.get_dag(dag_id)
        if not dag:
            raise ValueError(f"DAG with ID '{dag_id}' not found.")

        task = dag.get_task(task_id)
        print(f"Task '{task_id}' retrieved successfully from DAG '{dag_id}'.")
        return task

        print(f"Error retrieving task: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
# task = get_task("example_dag", "example_task")
# print(task)
2. Get Template Fields for a Specific Operator Class

        return []

# Example usage
# template_fields = get_template_fields("airflow.operators.bash.BashOperator")
# print(template_fields)
Explanation:
Retrieve Task Object:

Leverages Airflow's DagBag to load DAGs and retrieve the specified task by dag_id and task_id.

Includes error handling to manage scenarios where the DAG or task is not found.

Get Template Fields:

Dynamically imports the operator class using Python's importlib.

Extracts the template_fields attribute, which lists the fields that are templated for the operator class.

Handles errors gracefully in case the operator class is invalid or missing the required attributes.

Prerequisites:
Ensure Airflow is installed and configured properly in your environment.

The fullname for the second function should reference a valid operator class within Airflow.

Please generate a Python function that does the following: 
A role that allows you to include a list of template fields in the middle of the text. This is especially
    useful when writing guides describing how to use the operator.
    The result is a list of fields where each field is shorted in the literal block.

    Sample usage::

    :template-fields:`airflow.contrib.operators.gcp_natural_language_operator.CloudLanguageAnalyzeSentimentOperator`

      Text Roles) Please generate a Python function that does the following: 
Properly close pooled database connections
Copilot said
Here are the Python functions to address your requirements:

1. Define a Custom reStructuredText Role for Template Fields
This function defines a custom reStructuredText role to include template fields in the middle of the text. It utilizes Sphinx, a documentation generator.

python

Copy
from docutils import nodes
from docutils.parsers.rst import roles

def template_fields_role(name, rawtext, text, lineno, inliner, options={}, content=[]):
    """
    A custom reStructuredText role to include a list of template fields in the middle of text.

    :param name: The role name used in the document.
    :type name: str
    :param rawtext: The entire markup, including the role and text.
    :type rawtext: str
    :param text: The argument given to the role.
    :type text: str
    :param lineno: The line number where the text appears in the input.
    :type lineno: int
    :param inliner: The inliner instance that called the role function.
    :type inliner: docutils.parsers.rst.states.Inliner
    :param options: Directive options for customization.
    :type options: dict
    :param content: The content of the directive.
    :type content: list
    :return: A tuple of a list of nodes to insert and a list of system messages.
    :rtype: tuple
    """
    try:
        # Generate a literal block for the template fields
        literal_node = nodes.literal_block(text, text)
        return [literal_node], []
    except Exception as e:
        error = inliner.reporter.error(f"Error processing template fields: {str(e)}", line=lineno)
        return [error], []

# Example usage:
# Register the role in Sphinx
roles.register_local_role("template-fields", template_fields_role)
How to Use
In your reStructuredText documentation:

rst

Copy
:template-fields:`airflow.contrib.operators.gcp_natural_language_operator.CloudLanguageAnalyzeSentimentOperator`
This role converts the text into a literal block for inline usage.

2. Properly Close Pooled Database Connections
This function ensures pooled database connections are closed correctly, avoiding resource leaks.

python

Copy
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

def close_pooled_connections(engine):
    """
    Properly close pooled database connections.

    :param engine: The SQLAlchemy database engine.
    :type engine: sqlalchemy.engine.Engine
    :return: None
    """
    try:
        # Dispose of the connection pool
        engine.dispose()
        print("Database connections closed successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error closing database connections: {e}")

# Example usage
# engine = create_engine("postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@localhost/dbname")
# close_pooled_connections(engine)
Explanation:
Custom reStructuredText Role:

This role defines how to include a literal block of fields in the text.

It integrates seamlessly with Sphinx for rendering template fields.

Close Pooled Database Connections:

Utilizes SQLAlchemy's dispose() method to safely release pooled connections.

Prevents connection leaks by ensuring all database resources are properly managed.

These implementations should fulfill your requirements. Let me know if you'd like any further customization! 🚀

            print(f"Task {task_id} has finished execution.")
            return True
        else:
            print(f"Task {task_id} is not yet finished. Current state: {celery_result.state}")
            return False

Returns a pretty ascii table from tuples

    If namedtuple are used, the table will have headers
Copilot said
Here are the Python functions that implement the specified requirements:

1. Build a Dependency Chain for Tasks
This function takes a sequence of tasks and builds a dependency chain using set_downstream:

python

Copy
def build_dependency_chain(*tasks):
    """
    Given a number of tasks, builds a dependency chain.

    :param tasks: A variable number of tasks.
    :type tasks: iterable
    """
    try:
        for i in range(len(tasks) - 1):
            tasks[i].set_downstream(tasks[i + 1])
        print(f"Dependency chain successfully created for {len(tasks)} tasks.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error creating dependency chain: {e}")

# Example usage
# Assuming task_1, task_2, task_3, task_4 are valid task objects
# build_dependency_chain(task_1, task_2, task_3, task_4)
2. Create a Pretty ASCII Table from Tuples
This function converts a list of tuples into a formatted ASCII table. If the items are namedtuples, it automatically adds headers.

python

Copy
from prettytable import PrettyTable
from collections import namedtuple

def create_ascii_table(data):
    """
    Returns a pretty ASCII table from tuples.
    
    If namedtuples are used, the table will have headers.

    :param data: List of tuples or namedtuples.
    :type data: list
    :return: A string representation of the ASCII table.
    :rtype: str
    """
    try:
        if not data:
            raise ValueError("Data is empty or None.")

        # Check if the first item is a namedtuple
        first_item = data[0]
        if isinstance(first_item, tuple) and hasattr(first_item, "_fields"):  # It's a namedtuple
            headers = first_item._fields
        else:
            headers = [f"Column {i+1}" for i in range(len(first_item))]

        # Create and populate PrettyTable
        table = PrettyTable(headers)
        for row in data:
            table.add_row(row)
        
        return table.get_string()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error creating ASCII table: {e}")
        return ""

# Example usage
# Data as tuples
# data = [(1, "Alice", 25), (2, "Bob", 30), (3, "Charlie", 35)]
# print(create_ascii_table(data))

# Data as namedtuples
# Person = namedtuple("Person", ["ID", "Name", "Age"])
# data = [Person(1, "Alice", 25), Person(2, "Bob", 30), Person(3, "Charlie", 35)]
# print(create_ascii_table(data))
Explanation:
Dependency Chain for Tasks:

Iterates through the given tasks and sets the dependency chain using the set_downstream method.

Ensures that task_1 depends on task_2, task_2 on task_3, and so on.

Pretty ASCII Table:

Uses the prettytable module to create an ASCII table.

Dynamically detects whether the data contains namedtuples to set headers automatically.

If standard tuples are used, default column headers like "Column 1," "Column 2," etc., are generated.

Prerequisites:
For ASCII table generation, install the prettytable module:

bash

Copy
pip install prettytable
Ensure the task objects for build_dependency_chain have a set_downstream method.

# filename_template = "logs/${dag_id}/${task_id}/${execution_date}/try_${try_number}.log"
# log_filename = render_log_filename(ti, 1, filename_template)
# print(log_filename)
Explanation:
Terminate Process Group:

# print(coerce_to_string(dict_content))  # Output: {"name": "Alice", "age": "25", "height": "5.9"}
Explanation:
Await Google Cloud Dataproc Operation:

Polls a long-running Dataproc operation until it is marked as complete.

Implements a timeout to avoid indefinitely waiting for completion.

Logs progress and returns the operation's result upon success.

Coerce Content to String:

Converts a single value or all values in a dictionary to strings.

Ensures values are either strings or numeric types; otherwise, raises a TypeError.

Specifically handles compatibility for cases where a self.json field must comply with strict template rendering rules.

Prerequisites:
Await Dataproc Operation:

Install the google-cloud-dataproc library:

bash

Copy
pip install google-cloud-dataproc
Authenticate with Google Cloud by setting up the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable.

Coerce Content to String:

            raise

# Example usage
# ph = PigCliHook()
# result = ph.run_cli("ls /;")
# print(result)
Explanation:
Handle Databricks Operator Lifecycle:

The handle_databricks_operator function integrates with Airflow and executes lifecycle methods (pre_execute, execute, post_execute) for Databricks operators.

The lifecycle stages ensure pre- and post-execution tasks (if any) are appropriately handled.

Run Pig Script Using Pig CLI:

The run_cli method in PigCliHook interacts with the Apache Pig CLI to execute a script.

It captures the script's output or errors and gracefully handles failures by raising exceptions.

Prerequisites:
Databricks + Airflow Integration:

Install the Airflow Databricks provider package:

bash

Copy
pip install apache-airflow-providers-databricks
Apache Pig CLI:

Ensure Apache Pig is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.

Validate the setup by running pig -version.

    :type celery_task: tuple(str, celery.result.AsyncResult)
    :return: A tuple of the Celery task key and the Celery state of the task.
    :rtype: tuple[str, str]
    """
    try:
        task_key, async_result = celery_task
        task_state = async_result.state
        return task_key, task_state
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching Celery task state: {e}")
        return None, "ERROR"

# Example usage
# from celery.result import AsyncResult
# celery_task = ("task_key_example", AsyncResult("async_task_id"))
# print(fetch_celery_task_state(celery_task))
2. Determine How Many Tasks Should Each Worker Process Send
This function specifies the number of tasks that each worker process should send:

python

Copy
def get_tasks_per_worker_process():
    """
    Determines how many Celery tasks each worker process should send.

    :return: Number of tasks that should be sent per process.
    :rtype: int
    """
    try:
        # Define the logic for determining tasks per process
        tasks_per_process = 5  # Example value
        return tasks_per_process
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error determining tasks per worker process: {e}")
        return 0

# Example usage
# print(get_tasks_per_worker_process())
3. Determine How Many Tasks Should Be Sent to Each Worker Process
This function specifies the number of tasks that should be sent to a worker process:

python

Copy
def get_tasks_sent_to_worker_process():
    """
    Determines how many Celery tasks should be sent to each worker process.

    :return: Number of tasks that should be sent per process.
    :rtype: int

        print(f"Error determining tasks sent to worker process: {e}")
        return 0

# Example usage
# print(get_tasks_sent_to_worker_process())
Explanation:
Fetch Celery Task State:

Uses the state attribute of the AsyncResult object to determine the current state of a task.

Returns a tuple containing the task key and the task's state for simplicity in global access.

Tasks Per Worker Process:

Returns a predefined number (tasks_per_process) that represents how many tasks each worker process should send.

The logic can be dynamically adjusted based on your system's requirements.

Tasks Sent to Worker Process:

Similar to the above but focused on the number of tasks a worker process should handle.

Returns a predefined number (tasks_sent) for clarity and flexibility.

These functions are designed to be robust and adaptable for your use cases. Let me know if you'd like further refinements! 🚀

            value = VariableStore.store[key]
            # Decode the value from JSON if necessary
            return json.loads(value) if deserialize_json else value
        except Exception as e:
            raise ValueError(f"Error in setdefault: {e}")

# Example usage

        # Initialize and return the AI Platform (MLEngine) service client
        client = aiplatform.gapic.EndpointServiceClient()
        print("Successfully created AI Platform service object.")
        return client
    except Exception as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Error creating AI Platform service object: {e}")

# Example usage
# mle_service = get_mle_service()
# print(mle_service)
Explanation:
Custom setdefault Function:

Simulates the behavior of Python's dict.setdefault.

Stores a default value if the key is missing, with optional JSON serialization/deserialization for storage and retrieval.

Google AI Platform Service Object:

Creates a client for interacting with Google Cloud's AI Platform, formerly known as MLEngine.

    :param table_name: The name of the DynamoDB table.
    :type table_name: str
    :param items: A list of items to write to the table.
    :type items: list[dict]
    :return: A dict with the result of the batch write operation.
    :rtype: dict
    """
    try:
        dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
        table = dynamodb.Table(table_name)
        
        with table.batch_writer() as batch:
            for item in items:
                batch.put_item(Item=item)
        print(f"Successfully wrote {len(items)} items to table '{table_name}'.")
        return {"status": "SUCCESS", "count": len(items)}
    except (BotoCoreError, ClientError) as e:
        print(f"Error writing batch to DynamoDB table '{table_name}': {e}")
        return {"status": "FAILED", "error": str(e)}

# Example usage
# items = [{"id": "1", "name": "Item 1"}, {"id": "2", "name": "Item 2"}]
# result = write_batch_to_dynamodb("my_table", items)
# print(result)
2. Integrate Plugins into the Context

Copilot said
Here are Python functions for both tasks as you requested:

1. Creates a New Instance of the Configured Executor if None Exists
This function ensures that an executor instance is created based on a configured setting and returns it.

python

Copy
from airflow.executors.executor_loader import ExecutorLoader

_executor_instance = None

def get_configured_executor():
    """
    Creates a new instance of the configured executor if none exists and returns it.

    else:
        print("Returning existing executor instance.")
    return _executor_instance

# Example usage
# executor = get_configured_executor()
# print(executor)
2. Creates a New Instance of the Named Executor
This function initializes an executor by its name. If the executor name is unknown in Airflow, it checks for the executor in the plugins.

python

Copy
from airflow.executors.executor_loader import ExecutorLoader
from airflow.plugins_manager import plugins

def get_named_executor(executor_name):
    """
    Creates a new instance of the named executor.
    In case the executor name is not known in Airflow, look for it in the plugins.

    :param executor_name: The name of the executor to create.
    :type executor_name: str
    :return: The instance of the named executor.
    :rtype: airflow.executors.base_executor.BaseExecutor
    """
    try:
        executor_loader = ExecutorLoader()
        if executor_name in executor_loader.executor_mapping:
            print(f"Loading executor '{executor_name}' from Airflow core.")
            return executor_loader.executor_mapping[executor_name]()
        else:
            # Look for the executor in plugins
            for plugin in plugins:
                if executor_name in plugin.executors:
                    print(f"Loading executor '{executor_name}' from plugin '{plugin.name}'.")
                    return plugin.executors[executor_name]()
            raise ValueError(f"Executor '{executor_name}' not found in Airflow or plugins.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error creating named executor '{executor_name}': {e}")
        raise

# Example usage
# named_executor = get_named_executor("MyCustomExecutor")
# print(named_executor)
Explanation:
Get Configured Executor:

Checks if there is an existing executor instance; if not, creates one using the ExecutorLoader.

Returns the configured executor and ensures no duplicate instances are created.

Get Named Executor:

First attempts to find the executor by name in Airflow's core ExecutorLoader mapping.

If the executor is not available in Airflow's built-in mappings, it searches through Airflow plugins.

Throws an error if the executor is not found in either Airflow's core or plugins.

Prerequisites:
Ensure Airflow is installed and properly set up in your environment.

If using plugins, confirm that your custom executors are registered within the Airflow plugins framework.

These functions should work seamlessly within an Airflow project. Let me know if you need additional refinements! 🚀
